If you want to use a custom workflow that is not catered to by the [Vercel Git Integrations](/docs/v2/git-integrations), you may wish to use [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli#getting-started) to do so. This article covers some of the common use cases and tips on how to use the CLI successfully.

## Using the CLI Without Project Linking

For multiple environments beyond the provided [Production, Preview, and Development](/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables), or to map a single repository to multiple projects, skipping the [project linking](/docs/cli#commands/overview/project-linking) step may be required. You can do so by using the following command:

<Snippet dark text="VERCEL_ORG_ID=<value> VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=<value> vercel" />
<Caption>Using <InlineCode>VERCEL_ORG_ID</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>VERCEL_PROJECT_ID</InlineCode> system environment variables.</Caption>

Below is an example of a production deployment to a given team with a custom `vercel.json` path:

<Snippet dark text="VERCEL_ORG_ID=<value> VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=<value> vercel --prod --scope <value> -A production.vercel.json" />
<Caption>Advanced usage of the Vercel CLI with multiple flags.</Caption>

In the examples above, the following attributes are used:

1. **VERCEL_ORG_ID**: Can be found either by querying the [Vercel API](/docs/api#endpoints/teams/list-all-your-teams) or by inspecting the `.vercel` folder of a linked project.

2. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**: Can be found either by querying the [Vercel API](/docs/api#endpoints/projects/get-projects) or by inspecting the `.vercel` folder of a linked project.

3. **`--scope <value>`**: Your username or team slug.
