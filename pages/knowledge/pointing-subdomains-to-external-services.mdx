If your domain is managed by Vercel, meaning it is using Vercel nameservers, then you are able to point a subdomain to an external service by adding DNS records with the Vercel CLI.

## Adding an A Record

Locate the `value` and the `name` arguments requested by the external provider and use them in the DNS UI, replacing `name` with the name provided, and `127.0.0.1` with the value:

## Adding a CNAME Record

Locate the `value` and the `name` arguments requested by the external provider and use them in the DNS UI, replacing `name` with the name provided, and `cname.vercel-dns.com` with the value:

## Other Records

Any record, except for nameservers, can be added by using the [DNS UI](https://vercel.com/blog/dns-records-ui).

## Common Errors

When working with DNS records, it can be easy to make minor errors in the syntax, these can be difficult to debug. Below is a list of common errors made when adding DNS records and the steps required to resolve them.

### Using the domain as part of the "name" argument:

  height={324}
/>

To solve this problem, [remove the record](#removing-dns-records) and add it again **without** the domain as the "name" argument:
