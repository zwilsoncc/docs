By default, the Vercel platform blocks outgoing SMTP connections. This is done for security reasons to prevent malicious use of the platform.

As a result, it is not possible to use SMTP clients such as [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) to send email from [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction).

## Sending Email

To send emails from Vercel without restrictions, we recommend the use of a third-party mail services:

- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).
- [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).
- [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

The following guide can also be useful:

- [Deploy a SendGrid-Powered Contact Form with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-nodejs-and-sendgrid-with-vercel).

By using one of the services listed above, you will also benefit from analytics, scheduling, and many other features exclusively available from a specialized service.
