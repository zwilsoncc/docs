Using Cloudflare with [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains) on Vercel requires some minor steps to work correctly, this depends on whether the domain is being used with or without a proxy.

## Without Proxy (DNS only)

In this method, you need to insert a CNAME record with the value `cname.vercel-dns.com`.

    process.env.ASSETS
  }/knowledge/cloudflare-without-proxy.png`}

  height={332}

Following this method will guarantee the speed and reliability of your domain since Vercel will handle the subdomain.

<Note>
  CNAME flattening is a supported feature, however, it will impact the
  performance of your root domain. We recommend users to redirect the root
  domain (example.com) to the <InlineCode>www</InlineCode> subdomain
  (www.example.com) when possible.
</Note>

## With Proxy

If your domain does require the Cloudflare's proxy to be turned on by default, only one requirement is needed:

- The domain **must allow** HTTP requests (without HTTPS) to the path `/.well-known/**`.

  src={`${
    process.env.ASSETS
  }/knowledge/cloudflare-with-proxy.png`}
  width={1055}
  height={330}
/>
<Caption>A Cloudflare CNAME record that <strong>is not</strong> using a proxy.</Caption>

To verify if that is possible with your domain, you can run the following command (notice the `http://` part in the URL):

```bash
curl http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge -I
```

A configuration that does allow Vercel to run smoothly would return the following:

```bash
curl http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge -I
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

If you run the `curl` command and receive a `3XX` redirect instead, Cloudflare is preventing this route from being accessed, and Vercel will mark the domain as not configured:

```bash
curl http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge -I
HTTP/1.1 404 Moved Permanently
```

You need to explore the following configuration in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- [**Page Rules**](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427-Understanding-and-Configuring-Cloudflare-Page-Rules-Page-Rules-Tutorial-) — You can disable HTTPS for the path `/.well-known/**`.
- **[Always use HTTPS](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204144518-SSL-FAQ)** — This configuration is under the "SSL/TLS" tab and it may affect your page rules.
- **Other Configurations** — Cloudflare can offer multiple settings and this will directly affect Vercel's ability to generate certificates.

<Note>
  Vercel cannot offer Cloudflare-specific support. If you are facing
  difficulties with your Cloudflare managed domain, please reach out to their
