}

<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

This builder optimizes `.html` files using [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).

## When to use it

When you want your HTML source files to be minified so they are as small as possible (without any semantic changes) in production.

## How to use it

We'll define a `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>Hello there This is intentionally long</h1>
```

Then we'll define our build step to optimize our images:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/html-minifier" }]
}
```

When we deploy with `now` and `curl` the resulting deployment URL, we will notice the HTML has been compressed:

```bash
▲  curl https://optipng-deployment-f0hz0ny2d.now.sh/
<!doctype html><h1>Hello there This is intentionally long</h1>
```

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint is always a `.html` file you want to optimize.
