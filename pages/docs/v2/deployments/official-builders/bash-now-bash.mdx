    'The official Bash Builder for ZEIT Now. Write Bash functions that serve HTTP requests.'
}

The `@now/bash` Builder takes an entrypoint of a bash function, [imports](https://import.pw) its dependencies, and bundles them into a [Lambda](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

A simple "hello world" example:

```bash
handler() {
  echo "Hello, from Bash!"
}
```

## When to Use It

This Builder is the recommended way to build lambdas from shell functions.

## How to Use It

This example will detail creating an `uppercase` endpoint which will be accessed as `my-deployment.url/api/uppercase`. This endpoint will convert the provided querystring to uppercase using only Bash functions and standard Unix CLI tools.

Start by creating the project structure:

<TerminalInput>{`mkdir -p my-bash-project/api/uppercase
cd my-bash-project/api/uppercase`}</TerminalInput>

Inside the `my-bash-project > api > uppercase` directory, create an `index.sh` file with the following contents:

```bash
import "string@0.0.1"
import "querystring@1.3.0"

handler() {
  local path
  local query
  path="$(jq -r '.path' < "$REQUEST")"
  querystring "$path" | querystring_unescape | string_upper
}
```

<Caption>

The final step is to define a build that will take this entrypoint (`index.sh`), build it, and turn it into a lambda using [a `now.json` configuration](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) in the root directory (`my-bash-project`):

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "api/**/index.sh", "use": "@now/bash" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  A <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file using a build which takes a shell
  file and uses the <InlineCode>@now/bash</InlineCode> Builder to output a
  lambda.
</Caption>

The resulting deployment can be seen here: https://bash-o54wu79wa.now.sh/

Note, however, that it will return an empty response without a querystring.

By passing in a querystring, the lambda will return the uppercased version.
For example: https://bash-o54wu79wa.now.sh/api/uppercase?hello%20world

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint of this Builder is a shell file that defines a `handler()` function.
The `handler()` function is invoked for every HTTP request that the Lambda receives.

### Build Logic

If your Lambda requires additional resources to be added into the final bundle,
an _optional_ `build()` function may be defined.

Any files added to the _current working directory_ at build-time will be included
in the output Lambda.

```bash
build() {
  date > build-time.txt
}

handler() {
  echo "Build time:   $(cat build-time.txt)"
  echo "Current time: $(date)"
}
```

**Demo:** https://bash-build-j3adniz41.now.sh/

### Importing Dependencies

Bash, by itself, is not very useful for writing Lambda handler logic because it
does not have a standard library. For this reason, [`import`](https://import.pw)
is installed and configured by default, which allows your script to easily include
additional functionality and helper logic.

For example, the [`querystring` import](https://import.pw/querystring) may be
used to parse input parameters from the request URL:

```bash
import "querystring@1.3.0"

handler() {
  local path
  local query
  path="$(jq -r '.path' < "$REQUEST")"
  query="$(querystring "$path")"
  echo "Querystring is: $query"
}
```

**Demo:** https://bash-querystring-fommsvjvs.now.sh/?a=b

### Bash Version

With the `@now/bash` Builder, the handler script is executed using GNU Bash 4.

```bash
handler() {
  bash --version
}
```

**Demo:** https://bash-version-rkb5w4ua6.now.sh/

### Maximum Lambda Bundle Size

To help keep cold boot times minimal, the default [maximum output bundle size](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size) for a Bash lambda function is **`10mb`**.
This [limit is extendable](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview#configuring-output-lambda-size) up to **`50mb`**.

<Example>
  <span>
    Example <InlineCode>maxLambdaSize</InlineCode> configuration:
  </span>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.sh", "use": "@now/bash", "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "20mb" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>
