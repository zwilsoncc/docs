This builder takes in a Go program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a [Lambda](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

## When to Use It

Whenever you want to expose an API or a function written in Go.

## How to Use It

Define a `index.go` file inside a folder as follows:

```go
package handler

import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
)

func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "<h1>Hello from Go on Now!</h1>")
}
```

And define a `now.json` like:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.go", "use": "@now/go" }]
}
```

Notice that the API is cohesive with the `net/http` Go API. Your main entrypoint function **must be** an exported function.

The example above can be seen live from the following URL: <https://go-deployment-l78bij0fj.now.sh/>

Also, the source code of the deployment can be checked by appending `/_src` e.g. <https://go-deployment-l78bij0fj.now.sh/_src>.

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint file must be a `.go` source file containing an exported function that implements the `net/http` API.

<Note>
  <InlineCode>@now/go</InlineCode> will automatically detect a{' '}
  <InlineCode>go.mod</InlineCode> file to install dependencies at the entrypoint
  level.
</Note>

### Private packages

To install private packages with `go get`, define `GIT_CREDENTIALS` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

All major Git providers are supported including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, as well as a self-hosted Git server.

With GitHub, you will need to [create a personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with permission to access your private repository.

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "GIT_CREDENTIALS": "https://username:token@github.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### Version

Go 1.x is used.
