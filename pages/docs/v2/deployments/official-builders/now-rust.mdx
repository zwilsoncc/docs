<Tag>Status: Beta</Tag>

This Builder takes in a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) program and outputs it as a [Lambda](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

## When to Use It

Whenever you want to expose an API or a function written in Rust.

## How to Use It

Define an `index.rs` file inside a folder as follows:

```rust
use http::{Request, Response, StatusCode, header};

fn handler(request: Request<()>) -> http::Result<Response<String>> {
    let response = Response::builder()
        .status(StatusCode::OK)
        .header(header::CONTENT_TYPE, "text/html")
        .body("<!doctype html><html><head><title>A simple deployment with Now!</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to Rust on Now</h1></body></html>".to_string())
        .expect("failed to render response");

    Ok(response)
}
```

Define a `Cargo.toml` like so:

```
[package]
name = "rust-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
http = "0.1"
```

<Note>
  Your <InlineCode>Cargo.toml</InlineCode> file should contain the Rust crates
  used in your application.
</Note>

And define a `now.json` like:

```json
{
  "name": "rust-project",
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.rs",
      "use": "@now/rust"
    }
  ]
}
```

  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/overview#versioning">
    Now platform version
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  and a build step using the <InlineCode>@now/rust</InlineCode> Builder.
</Caption>

The example above can be seen live at <https://rust-kit-rm1x19uq8.now.sh/>.

Also, the source code of the deployment can be checked by appending `/_src` e.g. <https://rust-kit-rm1x19uq8.now.sh/_src>.

### Development

The `now dev` command allows you to develop lambdas locally on your machine. With `now dev` and `@now/rust` you can develop your rust-based lamdas on your own machine.

During local development with `now dev`, the assumption is that `rust` and `cargo` are already installed and available in your `PATH` since they will not be installed automatically. The recommended way to install `rust` and `cargo` on your machine is with [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

## Technical Details

### Entry Point

The entry point file can either be a `.rs` source file or a `Cargo.toml` file.

#### `.rs` Entry Point

When you use one or multiple `.rs` files as an entry point for this Builder, Now will setup the serverless environment for you.

The requirements for this entry point is to expose a `handler` function and not to have a `main` function.

The example for [the "How to Use It" section](#how-to-use-it) uses this method.

If a `Cargo.toml` exists in the project relating to the entry point, the dependencies will be installed for the Rust project.

#### `Cargo.toml` Entry Point

When using a `Cargo.toml` file as an entry point for this Builder, Now will use `cargo read-manifest` to build each binary within the project. As a result, **[cargo workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) are not supported as an entry point for Now** - you should read the [cargo workspace workaround](#cargo-workspaces-workaround) for further information.

This entry point method is an advanced method of using this Builder and requires Rust files to assemble their own runtimes.

Defining a `Cargo.toml` file as an entry point requires a Rust file at `src/main.rs` or files defined [as a \[\[bin\]\]\` target](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#configuring-a-target).

An example `src/main.rs` Rust file within a project including a `Cargo.toml` file acting as the entry point:

```rust
use http::{StatusCode, header};
use now_lambda::{error::NowError, lambda, IntoResponse, Request, Response};
use std::error::Error;

fn handler(request: Request) -> Result<impl IntoResponse, NowError> {
    let uri = request.uri();
    let response = Response::builder()
        .status(StatusCode::OK)
        .header(header::CONTENT_TYPE, "text/html")
        .body(format!(
            "You made a request to the following URL: {}",
            uri
        ))
        .expect("failed to render response");

    Ok(response)
}

// Start the runtime with the handler
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    Ok(lambda!(handler))
}
```

This requires one dependency, with the example above using another dependency, `http`.

The required dependency is [`now_lambda`](https://docs.rs/now_lambda) which provides all of the resources needed to provide the serverless runtime.

The `Cargo.toml` entry point for the example above is the following:

```
[package]
name = "rust-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
http = "0.1"
now_lambda = "*"
```

  <InlineCode>http</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>now_lambda</InlineCode>{' '}
  dependencies.
</Caption>

### Dependencies

This Builder supports installing dependencies defined in the `Cargo.toml` file.

Furthermore, more system dependencies can be installed at build time with the presence of a shell `build.sh` file in the same directory as the entry point file.

By default, [`openssl`](https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/openssl-devel-1.0.2k-16.el7.x86_64.rpm.html) is installed by the Builder due to its common usage with Rust projects.

### Rust Version

This builder uses [rustup](https://rustup.rs) to install `rust` and `cargo`. By default, the latest stable version of rust will be installed. To see what the current stable version of rust is, please see the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

If you need to use a different version of rust other than the latest stable version, you can specify a version of rust in your build's configuration. Accepted values are the same as [rustup's channel definition](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs/#toolchain-specification), which is `stable | latest | nightly | <version>`.

<Example>
  <span>
    Example <InlineCode>rust</InlineCode> version configuration:
  </span>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "Cargo.toml", "use": "@now/rust", "config": { "rust": "1.35" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>
</Example>

### Maximum Lambda Bundle Size

To help keep cold boot times low, the [maximum output bundle size](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size) for a Rust lambda is, by default, **`25mb`**.
This [limit is extendable](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview#configuring-output-lambda-size) up to **`50mb`**.

<Example>
  <span>
    Example <InlineCode>maxLambdaSize</InlineCode> configuration:
  </span>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.rs", "use": "@now/rust", "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "40mb" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>
</Example>

## Resources

The goal of the ZEIT Docs is to provide you with all the information you need to easily deploy your projects. The following resources can also help you set up other projects:

<Card title="Document: Builds Overview" href="/docs/v2/deployments/builds/">
  Learn all about build steps and what you can achieve with your Now-deployed
  projects.
</Card>

<Card title="Document: Deployment Overview" href="/docs/v2/deployments/basics/">
  Discover the deployment basics of Now.
</Card>

## Cargo Workspaces Workaround

Cargo's workspaces feature is a great tool when working on multiple binaries and libraries in a single project. If a cargo workspace is found in the entrypoint, however, `@now/rust` will **fail to build**.

To get around this limitation, create build entries in your `now.json` file for each `Cargo.toml` that represents a lambda function within your workspace. In your `.nowignore`, you'll want to add any binary or library project folders that aren't needed for your lambdas to speed up the build process like your `Cargo.toml` workspace.

It's also recommended to have a `Cargo.lock` alongside your lambda `Cargo.toml` files to speed up the build process. You can do this by running `cargo check` or a similar command within each project folder that contains a lambda.

If you have a compelling case for workspaces to be supported by `@now/rust` which are too cumbersome with this workaround, please contact us! We're always looking for feedback.
