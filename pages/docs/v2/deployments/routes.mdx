    'Create rewrites, redirects, cache-control headers, and more with Now routes, easily.'
}

Now uses routes to define the behavior of how a request is handled on the routing side. For example, you might use a route to rewrite a URL to another, redirect a user, or apply a header with the response to a request.

A route can be defined within a project's [`now.json` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#routes) as an object within an array assigned to the `routes` property, like the following which creates a simple rewrite from one path to another:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/about", "/about.html" }
  ]
}
```

## Routes Properties

Now Routes has multiple properties for each route object that help define the behavior of a response to each request to a particular path.

### `src`

**Type**: String supporting [PCRE Regex](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html)

For each route, `src` is required to set the path which the behavior will affect.

The following example shows a `now.json` configuration that takes a `src` path and rewrites it to a [destination `dest` path](#dest).

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/about", "dest": "/about.html" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>routes</InlineCode> property that rewrites one path to another
  upon request.
</Caption>

<Note>
  Both <InlineCode>^</InlineCode>, asserting the start of the path string, and{' '}
  <InlineCode>$</InlineCode>, asserting the end of the path string, are implied
  and are not necessary to write.
</Note>

### `dest`

**Type**: String

`dest` is used to rewrite the [`src`](#src) path to another path.

[The example for the `src` property](#src) shows how both methods work together to create a rewrite.

### `headers`

**Type**: Object

The `headers` property is an object supporting [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) as the keys, with the intended value as the key's value.

An example of using the `headers` property to add [shared caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Expiration) headers to all files in an `images` directory:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/images/.+", "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=604800" } }
  ]
}
```

  <InlineCode>images</InlineCode> directory with routes.
</Caption>

### `status`

**Type**: Integer

The `status` property defines the status code that Now should respond with when a path is requested.

For example, returning you can use this property in combinations with [the `headers` property](#headers) to create a redirect with the initial status code of 301 (Moved Permanently).

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/about.html",
      "status": 301,
      "headers": { "Location": "/about-us.html" }
    }
  ]
}
```

</Card>

### `methods`

**Type**: Array

The `methods` property can be used to define what a particular path accepts for as a request method.

The value of this property can be any [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), with the default being that the path can accept any method.

As an example, you can use this property when you have an API endpoint and only want to allow `GET` or `POST` request methods:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/api/user.js", "methods": ["POST", "GET"] }],
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

  that tells Now to build JavaScript files with Node.js and outputs them as{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/">
    lambdas
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

## Route Parameters

Using [PCRE Named Subpatterns](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#SEC16), or capture groups, you can capture a part of a path and use it in either the [`dest`](#dest) or [`headers`](#headers) properties.

Using route parameters enables you to change the format of your URLs easily without needing complicated routing code.

For example, if you are using URL parameters but want to use a custom URL path you can use the following:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/product/(?<id>[^/]+)$", "dest": "/product?id=$id" }]
}
```

This will take a URL, like `/product/532004` and rewrites it to `/product?id=532004` with the user seeing your custom URL in their browser.

As another example, if you want to redirect from all paths under a certain directory but want to keep the path in the new location, you can use the following:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/posts/(.*)",
      "status": 301,
      "headers": { "Location": "/blog/$1" }
    }
  ]
}
```
