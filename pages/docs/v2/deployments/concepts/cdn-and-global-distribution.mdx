All users can enjoy our [Smart Content Management Network](/smart-cdn) for allowing your content to be served as fast as possible.

## Smart CDN

Thanks to the **Smart CDN**, your **Static Files** will automatically be cached in all of our [regions](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers) whenever they are requested (no manual changes needed). Furthermore, this also gives you the ability to cache the responses of your **Lambdas** in those [regions](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers) too. For this to happen, you need to modify your code a little:

For your dynamic responses to be cached in all [edge points](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers), adjust your code to send a [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header containing a `s-maxage` (used for shared caches) parameter. Here is an example for **caching your response for 365 days**:

```
Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000
```

This is just an example, however.

Although this would be enough for ensuring your responses are cached in all [regions](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers) available within the Smart CDN, you should generally also include `max-age` (used for client caches), so that all clients (e.g., browsers) also know for how long to cache your responses:

```
Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000, max-age=0
```

As you can see above, the header is now instructing the client to expire any caches for the resource immediately. In general, we recommend this because it leverages Now's caches across the Full CDN instead of depending on the client's as well.

An important reason for this recommendation is that you have full control over purging Now's caches (unlike the client's), as you can read below.

If you do not specify a region (which can be done using the `--regions` flag in Now CLI), your [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) will only be created in the region that is closest to you.

It is recommended that you deploy your Lambdas closest to the data source as possible. If you have a database deployed in Paris, for example, it is natural that you deploy Lambdas to that region as well. If you need cache, just use [cache control headers](/docs/v2/routing/caching).

## Purging the Cache

By default, the cache for a response of your deployment is purged once the expiration timeout defined in `s-maxage` is reached.

Additionally, we also purge all caches related to a deployment when [an alias](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment) is created or updated, as this implies that new content needs to be served, thus requiring purging the caches.
