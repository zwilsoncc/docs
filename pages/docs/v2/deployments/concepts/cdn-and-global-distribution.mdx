    'Documentation for the concept of how ZEIT Now deployments can utilise the ZEIT CDN to host and serve content at the edge.'
}

We offer two kinds of Content Management Networks (depending on your [pricing plan](/pricing)) for allowing your content to be served as fast as possible.

## Basic CDN

On both [pricing plans](/pricing), you can create deployments in any [region](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers) within our **Basic CDN**:

- [BRU](https://bru.zeit.co/) (Brussels, Belgium, West Europe)
- [SFO](https://sfo.zeit.co/) (San Francisco, West US)
- [GRU](https://gru.zeit.co) (São Paulo, Brazil)
- [IAD](https://iad.zeit.co/) (Washington DC, East US)

If you do not specify a region (which can be done using the `--region` flag in Now CLI), your [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) will only be created in one of these regions: The one that is closest to you.

However, **Static Files** are served from all of these regions, no matter if `--region` was used.

## Full CDN

If you decide to upgrade to the [Unlimited plan](/pricing) (which we highly recommend), you are granted access to our Full CDN. This term includes **all of the regions mentioned above**, plus **over 150 more locations for caching:** [List of locations](/cdn)**.**

Thanks to the **Full CDN**, your **Static Files** will automatically be cached in any of those regions whenever they are requested (no manual changes needed). Furthermore, this also gives you the ability to cache the responses of your **Lambdas** in those regions too. For this to happen, you need to modify your code a little:

For your dynamic responses to be cached in all of these regions, adjust your code to send a [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header containing a `s-maxage` (used for shared caches) parameter. Here is an example for **caching your response for 365 days**:

```
Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000
```

This is just an example, however.

Although this would be enough for ensuring your responses are cached in all regions available within the Full CDN, you should generally also include `maxage` (used for client caches), so that all clients (e.g., browsers) also know for how long to cache your responses:

```
Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000, maxage=0
```

As you can see above, the header is now instructing the client to expire any caches for the resource immediately. In general, we recommend this because it leverages Now's caches across the Full CDN instead of depending on the client's as well.

An important reason for this recommendation is that you have full control over purging Now's caches (unlike the client's), as you can read below.

## Purging the Cache

By default, the cache for a response of your deployment is purged once the expiration timeout defined in `s-maxage` is reached.

Furthermore, we also purge all caches related to a deployment when `now alias` is used to assign the alias of the deployment to a different deployment, as this implies that new content needs to be served, thus requiring purging the caches.
