    'The usage of special paths with ZEIT Now deployment URLs or aliases to access features such as logs or the deployment source view.',

}

All deployment URLs have two special pathnames:

- `/_src`
- `/_logs`

## Source view

By appending `/_src` to a [deployment URL](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/urls) or [alias](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment), the deployment inspector will be open and you'll be able to browse your deployment sources and [build](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) outputs.

## Logs view

By appending `/_logs` to a [deployment URL](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/urls) or [alias](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment), you will be able to see a realtime stream of logs from your deployment build processes and serverless invocations.

## Security considerations

These pathnames redirect to `https://zeit.co` and _require logging in_ to access any sensitive information. A 3rd-party can _never_ access your source or logs by crafting a deployment URL with one of these paths.
