​​<ProductName /> provides integrations for your [GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-gitlab), and [Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-bitbucket) projects, allowing for **automatic deployments on every branch push** and merge to the default branch.

The <ProductName /> Git Integrations provide the following benefits:

- [Preview Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview) for every push.
- [Production Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production) for the most recent changes from the default branch.
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes assigned to a custom domain.

The easiest way to use a Git Integration is to think of your **default branch as production**. Every time a pull/merge request is made to the default branch, <ProductName /> will **create a unique deployment**, allowing you to **view the changes in a preview environment before merging**.

When merging to the default branch, a **Production Deployment** is made, making the latest changes available to assigned custom domains automatically.

## Available Integrations

Click any Git Integration from the list below to skip to its section:

## Quick Installation

You can install any Git Integration directly from your dashboard by clicking ["Import Project"](/import) followed by ["From Git Repository"](/import/git). Then from the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket tabs in the "You own the Repository" section, click the "Connect" or "Install" button.

## Deploying Private Git Repositories

In order to deploy commits from a private Git Repository (or a fork of a private Git Repository) under a Team, the commit author has to be a member of the Team on <ProductName /> (even if the commit author is a bot).

If the commit author is not a member, the Deployment will be prevented and a request to join the Team will automatically be issued for the commit author. After that, the owners of the Team will be notified and can either accept or decline the membership request on the "Members" page in the Team Settings.

Declining the request will leave the commit undeployed. If the commit author gets accepted as a member of the Team, however, their most recent commit will resume to be deployed to <ProductName /> automatically.

Commit authors will automatically be considered a part of the Team on <ProductName /> if one of the existing members connected their Personal Account on <ProductName /> with the Git account that created the commit.
