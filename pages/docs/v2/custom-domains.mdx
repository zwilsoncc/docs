By default, all deployments are assigned a `.now.sh` prefixed domain.

This domain can be replaced with a **Custom Domain** of your choice. This Custom Domain can be purchased with ZEIT or a third-party.

In this document, adding a domain to your ZEIT Now [projects](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) is explained in detail.

## Adding a Domain

If you don't own a domain yet, you can [purchase it with ZEIT](https://zeit.co/domains). Then, once you own a domain, adding it to a project is very straightforward:

### Step 1: Selecting Your Project

On the [dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard), pick the project to which you would like to assign your domain:

<Caption>Selecting the project from the ZEIT Dashboard.</Caption>

### Step 2: Navigating to Domain Settings

Once you have selected the project of your choice, click on the **Domains** item in the menubar:

  width={728 / 2}
  height={274 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>Selecting the <b>Domains</b> tab from the Project Overview page.</Caption>

### Step 3: Entering Your Chosen Domain

From the **Project Domains** page, enter the domain you wish to add to the project:

  width={1350 / 2}
  height={447 / 2}
  shadow

### Step 4: Verifying the Domain

Once the domain has been added, you will be presented with different methods for verifying it, depending on whether it is an **apex domain** (zeit.co) or **subdomain** (docs.zeit.co).

Both domain types can be verified using the **Nameservers** method, however **apex domains** also allow for verification via the **ANAME** record, whilst **subdomains** allow for verification via the **CNAME** record.

#### Apex Domains

You can verify apex domains either through the **Nameservers** or **ANAME** methods.

#### Subdomains

You can verify subdomains either through the **Nameservers** or **CNAME** methods.

### Step 5: Domain Verified

Once the domain has been verified, the card status will change to reflect this.

## Wildcard Domains

You can use your custom domain as a Wildcard Domain by prefixing it with `*.`.

<Note type="warning">
  If using your custom domain as a Wildcard Domain, you{' '}
  <b>must use the nameservers method for verification</b>.
</Note>

To add a Wildcard Domain, follow the steps to [add a domain](#step-1:-selecting-your-project), the only change being; at [step 3](#step-3:-entering-your-chosen-domain), where you should instead use the prefix mentioned above, for example; `*.acme.com`.

  width={1350 / 2}
  height={532 / 2}
  shadow
/>

After the verification process is complete, the status of the domain will be updated within the UI to confirm that it is ready for use.

## Deploying with Your Domain

Once the domain has been added to your project and verified, it is **automatically applied to your latest deployment**.

If you want to update your production deployment, there are two options available, [using Now CLI](#using-now-cli) or [with Git](#with-git).

<Note>
  The first successful deployment of a new project will be marked as production
  and subsequently assigned with your custom domain automatically if you have
  used one of the following methods.
</Note>

### Using Now CLI

To update your production deployment, you can use the `--prod` argument with the [`now` command](/docs/now-cli/#commands/now) in your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="now --prod" />

### With Git

When a custom domain is assigned as a production domain to a project with a [Now for Git integration](/docs/v2/git-integration) enabled, each push (including merges) to the default branch (commonly `master`) will trigger a deployment to the defined domain.

Reverts take effect immediately, assigning the custom domain to the deployment made prior to the point the revert is effective from.

## Redirecting Domains

You can add domain redirects from the **Domains** tab when more than one domain is present for the project. This provides a way to, for example, redirect a `www` subdomain to an apex domain but can be used in a variety of ways.

To add a redirect, select the domain you want to redirect to from the **Redirect to** dropdown:

## Removing a Domain

To remove a domain that is assigned to your ZEIT account or team, navigate to the **Domains** tab from the Project Overview and click the **Edit** button for the domain you want to remove:

Once the **Edit** button has been clicked, you will be presented with further options. Click the **Remove** button to remove the domain from the project:
