When you make a deployment with ZEIT Now, the first step is the build step. Now recognizes a custom `build` script, with that build script outputting your app into the `public` directory.

Now also supports optimized frameworks that only need to be created and then they are ready to deploy with [Now CLI](/download) from the terminal.

You are also able to use [Environment Variables](#using-environment-variables-and-secrets) (including secrets) in your builds if you do not want to hardcode values for the build.

## Optimized Frameworks

A variety of frameworks have been optimized for ZEIT Now. The following list contains those frameworks that have been optimized and what has been done to aid their performance only on Now. Any getting started method will immediately be ready to deploy with [Now CLI's `now` command](/download) from the terminal, or to be deployed with a [Git integration](/docs/v2/git-integration):

| Framework        | Get Started Command                               | Optimized                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Next.js          | `npm create next-app my-next-project`             | <CenteredIcon size="24"/> |
| Create React App | `npx create-react-app my-cra-project`             | <CenteredIcon size="24"/> |

## Defining a Build Script

To build your project, Now looks for a `build` script inside of a `package.json` file. By providing a build script, Now will build your project from fresh on every deployment.

For example, to build Next.js fresh, each time you deploy, the following `build` script should be placed in the `package.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

  <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script that builds Next.js on each deploy.

## Using Environment Variables and Secrets

### Adding Secrets

To define an environment variable, you should use **Now Secrets**. By using **Now Secrets**, the data will be encrypted and stored securely, no longer directly accessible by anyone, and only exposed to deployments as environment variables.

Adding **Now Secrets** can be done with [Now CLI](/download), providing three options to work with them.

To **define a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>"/>
<Caption>Defining a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

To **remove a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rm <secret-name>"/>
<Caption>Removing a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

To **rename a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rename <secret-name> <new-name>"/>
<Caption>Renaming a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

### Providing Environment Variables

To provide your project with environment variables during the build script, you should create a `now.json` file like the one below:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "VARIABLE_NAME": "@secret-name"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  application's build step with a defined environment variable.
</Caption>

To use the environment variable from inside the application you would need to reference it using the correct syntax for the language being used. For example, using Node.js, the syntax would be:

```
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

Now, whenever the `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` key is used, it will provide the application's build step with the value declared by the referenced **Now Secret**.

## Ignored Files and Folders

By default, ZEIT Now ignores certain files and folders for security and performance reasons, preventing them from being uploaded during the deployment process.

```bash
.hg
.git
.gitmodules
.svn
.cache
.next
.now
.npmignore
.dockerignore
.gitignore
.*.swp
.DS_Store
.wafpicke-*
.lock-wscript
.env
.env.build
.venv
npm-debug.log
config.gypi
node_modules
__pycache__/
venv/
CVS
```

  process.

<Note hint>
  You do not need to add any of the above files and folders to your{' '}
  <InlineCode>.nowignore</InlineCode> file.
</Note>
