Builders are modules that transform your source code into compiled outputs, being either static files and/or [Serverless Functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/lambdas/), which are served by our [CDN at the edge](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/cdn-and-global-distribution/).

<Note warning>
  In most cases, advanced Builders usage with configuration is not necessary.

## Official Builders

Listed below are all official Builders from ZEIT.

| Builder                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Static](#static)               | The Static Builder takes any file as an entrypoint and moves it to the deployment as a static file.                                                                               |
| [Static Builds](#static-builds) | The Static Builds Builder takes a `package.json` or `build.sh` file as an entrypoint and executes a command within them to produce static files in a `public` directory to serve. |
| [Node.js](#node.js)             | The Node.js Builder takes an entrypoint of a Node.js function, builds its dependencies (if any) and bundles them into a Serverless Function.                                      |
| [Next.js](#next.js)             | The Next.js Builder takes a Next.js application, defined by a `next.config.js` entrypoint and pages directory, and converts those pages into a series of Serverless Functions.    |
| [Go](#go)                       | The Go Builder takes in a Go program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a Serverless Function.                                                                |
| [Python](#python)               | The Python Builder takes in a Python program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a Serverless Function.                                                        |
| [Ruby](#ruby)                   | The Ruby Builder takes in a Ruby program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a Serverless Function.                                                            |

## Static

<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

The Static Builder is used to serve files statically in a project by default when there is no [static build](#static-builds) defined, or if a `public` directory exists, that directory is served instead.

<Note>
  Files inside an <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory are not served
  statically.
</Note>

To configure the behavior of this Builder to affect specific files explicitly, see the [Advanced Builders Usage section](#advanced-builders-usage).

---

## Static Builds

<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

By default, the Static Builds Builder is used when Now detects a `build` script inside a `package.json` file at the root of a project. This script is executed when deploying, and if the output is built to a `public` directory, that directory is served.

For example, to build a Gatsby project, you would use the following `scripts` object in a `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "gatsby build"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script to build Gatsby.
</Caption>

To configure the behavior of this Builder to affect specific files explicitly, see the [Advanced Static Builds Configuration section](#advanced-static-builds-configuration).

### Static Build Project Node.js Version

The default Node.js version used is **8.10.x** but can be changed to **10.x** by defining [engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) in `package.json`.

### Static Build npm Dependencies

For dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, the following behavior is used:

- If a `package-lock.json` file is present in the project, `npm install` is used.
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used, by default.

---

## Node.js

<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

The Node.js Builder, by default, builds and serves Serverless Functions within the `/api` directory of a project, providing the files have a file extension of either `.js` or `.ts`.

A Node.js Serverless Function must export a default function handler, for example:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

<Caption>
  An example serverless Node.js function using{' '}
  <GenericLink href="#node.js-request-and-response-objects">

  </GenericLink>
  .
</Caption>

<Note>
  The Node.js Builder also supports{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">
    {' '}
    asynchronous functions
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

If you need more advanced behavior, such as a custom build step or private npm modules, see the [Advanced Node.js Usage section](#advanced-node.js-usage).

### Node.js Version

The default Node.js version used is **8.10.x** but can be changed to **10.x** by defining [engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) in `package.json`.

### Node.js Dependencies

**For dependencies** listed in a `package.json` file at the root of a project, the following behavior is used:

- If a `package-lock.json` file is present in the project, `npm install` is used.
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used, by default.

### Using TypeScript with the Node.js Builder

The Node.js Builder supports files ending with `.ts` inside of the `/api` directory as TypeScript files to compile and serve when deploying.

An example TypeScript file that exports a default Node.js function and takes in [the standard Node.js Request and Response](#request-and-response-objects) objects is as follows:

```js
import { NowRequest, NowResponse } from '@now/node'

export default function(req: NowRequest, res: NowResponse) {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

<Caption>
  An example serverless Node.js function written in TypeScript, using types from
  the <InlineCode>@now/node</InlineCode> module for the helper methods.
</Caption>

The `NowRequest` and `NowResponse` imports in the above example are types that we provide for [the Request and Response objects](#node.js-request-and-response-objects), including the [helper methods](#node.js-helpers) with ZEIT Now. These types can be installed from npm with the following command:

<Snippet dark text="npm install @now/node --save-dev" />
<Caption>Installing <InlineCode>@now/node</InlineCode> for types when using Node.js on ZEIT Now.</Caption>

You can also use a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of your project to configure the TypeScript compiler. Most options are supported aside from ["Path Mappings"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) and ["Project References"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html).

### Node.js Request and Response Objects

Each request to a Node.js Serverless Function gives access to Request and Response objects. These objects are the standard HTTP [Request](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request) and [Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) objects from Node.js.

#### Node.js Helpers

ZEIT Now additionally provides helper methods inside of the Request and Response objects passed to Node.js Serverless Functions. These methods are:

| method             | description                                                                                                                                                                                    | object   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `req.query`        | An object containing the request's [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string), or `{}` if the request does not have a query string.                                            | Request  |
| `req.cookies`      | An object containing the cookies sent by the request, or `{}` if the request contains no cookies.                                                                                              | Request  |
| `req.body`         | An object containing the body sent by the request, or `null` if no body is sent.                                                                                                               | Request  |
| `res.status(code)` | A function to set the status code sent with the response where `code` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). Returns `res` for chaining. | Response |
| `res.send(body)`   | A function to set the content of the response where `body` can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`.                                                                                       | Response |
| `res.json(obj)`    | A function to send a JSON response where `obj` is the JSON object to send.                                                                                                                     | Response |

The following Node.js Serverless Function example showcases the use of `req.query`, `req.cookies` and `req.body` helpers:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  let who = 'anonymous'

  if (req.body && req.body.who) {
    who = req.body.who
  } else if (req.query.who) {
    who = req.query.who
  } else if (req.cookies.who) {
    who = req.cookies.who
  }

  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${who}!`)
}
```

<Caption>
  Example Node.js Serverless Function using the{' '}
  <InlineCode>req.query</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>req.cookies</InlineCode>, and{' '}
  <InlineCode>req.body</InlineCode> helpers. It returns greetings for the user
  specified using <InlineCode>req.send()</InlineCode>.
</Caption>

  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

#### `req.body`

We populate the `req.body` property with a parsed version of the content sent with the request when possible.

We follow a set of rules on the `Content-type` header sent by the request to do so:

| `Content-Type` header               | Value of `req.body`                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No header                           | `undefined`                                                                             |
| `application/json`                  | An object representing the parsed JSON sent by the request.                             |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | An object representing the parsed data sent by with the request.                        |
| `text/plain`                        | A string containing the text sent by the request.                                       |
| `application/octet-stream`          | A [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) containing the data sent by the request. |

With the `req.body` helper, you can build applications without extra dependencies or having to [parse the content of the request manually](https://nodejs.org/ja/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body).

## Next.js

<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

The [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) Builder is used to deploy production-ready Next.js applications when a `pages` directory exists (along with the `next` dependency existing in a `package.json` file).

The Next.js Builder converts pages into a series of individual Serverless Functions or static files, depending on their implementation, and caches `node_modules` and compiler artifacts by default for faster deployment.

To build your Next.js projects with each deployment, provide the following `build` script in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script to build Next.js when deploying.
</Caption>

<Note>
  This Builder separates your pages into individual Serverless Functions, so you
  cannot use a custom server. You can still achieve most of the logic that you
  have in a custom server by using{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs/#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle">
    <InlineCode>getInitialProps()</InlineCode>
  </GenericLink>
  . For more on advanced routing, see the <GenericLink href="/guides/custom-next-js-server-to-routes">
    Custom Routes Guide for Next.js on ZEIT Now
  </GenericLink>.
</Note>

For more advanced usage of Next.js on ZEIT Now, such as environment variables or private npm modules, see [the Advanced Next.js Usage section](#advanced-next.js-usage).

### Next.js Project Node.js Version

The default Node.js version used is **8.10.x** but can be changed to **10.x** by defining [engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) in `package.json`.

### Next.js Project Dependencies

**For dependencies** listed in a `package.json` file at the root of a project, the following behavior is used:

- If a `package-lock.json` file is present in the project, `npm install` is used.
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used, by default.

---

## Go

<Tag>Status: Alpha</Tag>

The Go Builder is used by Now to compile Go Serverless Functions that expose a single HTTP handler, including using the `net/http` Go API, from a `.go` file within an `/api` directory at your project's root.

For example, define an `index.go` file inside an `/api` directory as follows:

```go
package handler

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "<h1>Hello from Go on Now!</h1>")
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.go</InlineCode> file inside an{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

For advanced usage, such as using private packages with your Go projects, see the [Advanced Go Usage section](#advanced-go-usage).

### Go Version

Go version 1.x is used for Go projects deployed with ZEIT Now.

### Go Dependencies

The Go Builder will automatically detect a `go.mod` file to install dependencies at the root of a project.

---

## Python

<Tag>Status: Beta</Tag>

The Python Builder is used by Now to compile Python Serverless Functions, that defines a singlular HTTP `handler` variable, inheritting from the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class, from a `.py` file within an `/api` directory at your project's root.

For example, define an `index.py` file inside a `/api` directory as follows:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from cowpy import cow

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','text/plain')
        self.end_headers()
        message = cow.Cowacter().milk('Hello from Python from a ZEIT Now Serverless Function!')
        self.wfile.write(message.encode())
        return
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file inside an{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
cowpy==1.0.3
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file that defines{' '}
  <InlineCode>cowpy</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

For advanced usage, such as using WSGI or ASGI for your Python projects, see the [Advanced Python Usage section](#advanced-python-usage).

### Python Version

Python projects deployed with ZEIT Now use Python version 3.6.

### Python Dependencies

You can install dependencies for your Python projects by defining them in a `requirements.txt` or a `Pipfile.lock` file.

---

## Ruby

<Tag>Status: Alpha</Tag>

The Ruby Builder is used by Now to compile Ruby Serverless Functions that define a singlular HTTP handler from `.rb` files within an `/api` directory at your project's root.

Ruby files must have one of the following variables defined:

- `Handler` proc that matches the `do |req, res|` signature.
- `Handler` class that inherits from the `WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet` class.

For example, define a `index.rb` file inside a `/api` directory as follows:

```ruby
require 'cowsay'

Handler = Proc.new do |req, res|
    res.status = 200
    res['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
    res.body = Cowsay.say('hello world', 'cow')
end
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.rb</InlineCode> file inside an{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

Inside a `Gemfile` define:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "cowsay", "~> 0.3.0"
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>Gemfile</InlineCode> file that defines{' '}
  <InlineCode>cowpy</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

For advanced usage, such as using a Rack Interface for your Ruby projects, see the [Advanced Ruby Usage section](#advanced-ruby-usage).

### Ruby Version

Ruby 2.5.3 is used.

### Ruby Dependencies

This Builder supports installing dependencies defined in the `Gemfile`. Alternatively, dependencies can be vendored with the `bundler install --deployment` command (useful for gems that require native extensions). In this case, dependencies are not built on deployment.

---

## Advanced Builders Usage

<Note warning>
  Using Builders in advanced configuration will disable the zero configuration
  functionality of ZEIT Now.
</Note>

If your project has source files that need to be built requiring a different structure than Now provides by default, you can use Builders with advanced configuration to achieve that structure.

Builders can be used with Now by creating a `now.json` file in a project and then [using a `builds` property](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#builds) within that configuration:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/static" },
    { "src": "date.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file using build steps.
</Caption>

The `builds` property is an array of objects where each object is a build step, including a `src` and a `use` property, at least.

The Builder will receive a list of files based on the `src` property's [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) value.

<Note>
  It is important to remember that the <InlineCode>src</InlineCode> property is
  a glob. In the above example, this will only use the Static Builder for the
  HTML files in the root directory. If you need it to be used throughout
  subdirectories, you need the appropriate glob syntax:{' '}
  <InlineCode>**/*.html</InlineCode>.
</Note>

The `use` property of a build step can contain the name of a Builder module published to npm. For example, the following list contains the Official Builders and their module names to use.

| Builder      | Builder Module      |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Static       | `@now/static`       |
| Static Build | `@now/static-build` |
| Node.js      | `@now/node`         |
| Next.js      | `@now/next`         |
| Go           | `@now/go`           |
| Python       | `@now/python`       |
| Ruby         | `@now/ruby`         |

Since Builders are published to [npm](https://npmjs.com), the `use` statement in your [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration) uses a similar syntax to `npm install`, meaning that versioning can be used by tagging the builders, like for example:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "api/**/*.js", "use": "@now/node@0.12.3" }]
}
```

#### Community Builders

The following is a list of community maintained Builders.

| Builder | Builder Module | Docs                                     |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| PHP     | `now-php`      | <https://github.com/juicyfx/now-php>     |
| Rust    | `now-rust`     | <https://github.com/mike-engel/now-rust> |

<Note>
  If you need to create a custom Builder, see the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="#developing-your-own-builder">
    Developing Your Own Builder section
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

### Advanced Static Builds Configuration

<Note alert>
  The following configuration step will disable the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/introduction">
    zero configuration nature
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of ZEIT Now, and you will have to define build steps for all source files that
  you intend to serve from your deployments.
</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Static Builds Builder by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Static Builds Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point for `src` must be a `package.json` file** with a `build` script that, when executed, compiles the built application into a `public` directory.

#### Configuring the Build Output Directory with Static Builds Builder

If you want to configure a directory other than `public` for your build output, you can pass an optional `distDir` option in the builder's config:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "www" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that uses the Static Builds
  Builder with a configured output directory.
</Caption>

#### Shell File Entry Point for Static Builds

Using a file with a `.sh` file extension as an entry point for the `@now/static-build` Builder allows you to define build instructions in a shell file.

For example, creating a shell file, with the name `build.sh`, with the following contents, will install and build a [Hugo project](https://zeit.co/guides/deploying-hugo-with-now/):

```shell
curl -L -O https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar -xzf hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

./hugo
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

For depencency installation with [shell file entry points](#shell-file-entry-point), `yum` is available.

#### Private npm Modules for Static Builds

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build-env) in a `now.json` file.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build.env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

### Advanced Node.js Usage

<Note alert>
  The following configuration step will disable the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction">
    zero configuration nature
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of ZEIT Now, and you will have to define build steps for all source files that
  you intend to serve from your deployments.
</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Node.js Builder, to compile Node.js source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Node.js Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point for `src` must be a glob matching `.js` or `.ts` files** that export a default function. For more information on using this Builder, [see the Node.js Builder section](#node.js).

#### Disabling Helpers for Node.js

Within a `now.json` configuration file at your project's root, use the following build step with config to disable [helpers](#node.js-helpers).

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "my-file.js",
      "use": "@now/node",
      "config": { "helpers": "false" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that has a build step using

</Caption>

#### Private npm Modules for Node.js

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build.env) in `now.json`.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build.env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

#### Custom Build Step for Node.js

You can run build tasks by creating a `now-build` script within a `package.json` file at the entry point's level or higher. For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "now-build": "node ./build.js"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script to execute in the build step.
</Caption>

Along with build script named `build.js`:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFile('built-time.js', (module.exports = '${new Date()}'), err => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('Build time file created successfully!')
})
```

<Caption>
  An example Node.js file, executed by the above{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> build script.
</Caption>

And a `.js` file for the built Serverless Functions, `index.js` inside the `/api` directory:

```js
const BuiltTime = require('./built-time')
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/plain')
  res.send(`
    This Serverless Function was built at ${new Date(BuiltTime)}.
    The current time is ${new Date()}
  `)
}
```

<Caption>
  An example Node.js Serverless Function, using information from the created
  file from the build script.
</Caption>

#### Legacy Serverful Behavior

A Node.js Builder entrypoint can contain one of the following to retain legacy serverful behavior:

- Default export server, such as `module.exports = http.createServer((req, res) => { res.end('hello') })`.
- Server listens on a port, such as `http.createServer((req, res) => { res.end('hello') }).listen(3000)`.

### Advanced Next.js Usage

<Note alert>
  The following configuration step will disable the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/introduction">

  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of ZEIT Now, and you will have to define build steps for all source files that
  you intend to serve from your deployments.
</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Next.js Builder, to compile Next.js source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/next" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Next.js Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder** is a `package.json` file with Next.js 9 or newer defined in `dependencies`. For more information on using this Builder, [see the Next.js Builder section](#next.js).

For more information on this, see [the Next.js documentation](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#serverless-deployment).

#### Private npm Modules for Next.js

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build.env) in `now.json`.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build.env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

#### Environment Variables with Next.js

To support environment variables, Next.js inlines the provided values into the JavaScript bundle at build.

You can add the `env` key to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  env: {
    customKey: process.env.customKey,
    mySecret: process.env.mySecret
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>next.config.js</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

Then, [expose the build env](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets) in your `now.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "customKey": "value",
      "mySecret": "@my-secret-name"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file specifying a build
  environment variable.

You can configure your own build step using the Go Builder, to compile Go source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.go", "use": "@now/go" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step

</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder is a global matching `.go` files** that export a function that implements the `net/http` API. For more information on using this Builder, [see the Go Builder section](#go).

#### Private Packages for Go

To install private packages with `go get`, define `GIT_CREDENTIALS` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

All major Git providers are supported including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, as well as a self-hosted Git server.

With GitHub, you will need to [create a personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with permission to access your private repository.

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "GIT_CREDENTIALS": "https://username:token@github.com"
    }
  }
}
```

You can configure your own build step using the Python Builder, to compile Python source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.py", "use": "@now/python" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Python Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder is a glob matching `.py` source files** with one of the following variables defined:

- `handler` that inherits from the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class.
- `app` that exposes a WSGI or ASGI Application.

#### Web Server Gateway Interface

The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications written in Python. You can use WSGI with frameworks such as Flask or Django.

Instead of defining a `handler`, define an `app` variable in your Python file, when using `now.json` config. For example, define a `index.py` file inside your project as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask, Response
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def catch_all(path):
    return Response("<h1>Flask on Now</h1><p>You visited: /%s</p>" % (path), mimetype="text/html")
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file, using Flask for a WSGI
  application.

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
flask==1.0.2
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file, listing{' '}
  <InlineCode>flask</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

#### Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface

The Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) is a calling convention for web servers to forward requests to asynchronous web applications written in Python. You can use ASGI with frameworks such as [Sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io).

Instead of defining a `handler`, define an `app` variable in your Python file.

For example, define a `index.py` file inside a folder as follows:

```python
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import json
app = Sanic()


@app.route('/')
@app.route('/<path:path>')
async def index(request, path=""):
    return json({'hello': path})
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file, using Sanic for a ASGI
  application.

}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Ruby Builder.

**The entry point of this Builder is a glob matching `.rb` or `.ru` (for [Rack](#rack-interface)) source files** with one of the following variables defined:

- `Handler` proc that matches the `do |req, res|` signature.
- `Handler` class that inherits from the `WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet` class.

For more information on using this Builder, [see the Ruby Builder section](#ruby).

Alternatively, [a `.ru` Rack config file](#rack-interface) will serve the Ruby application it contains.

#### Rack Interface

Many Ruby frameworks interface with [Rack](https://rack.github.io/) for forwarding HTTP requests to web applications written in Ruby. You can use Rack with frameworks such as Sinatra or Rails.

Instead of defining a handler, write the application as usual, like this Sinatra application:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/*' do
    'Hello world'
end
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>Sinatra</InlineCode> application.

Inside `Gemfile` define:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "sinatra", "~> 2.0"
gem "rack", "~> 2.0"
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>Gemfile</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

Add a Rack config file at `index.ru` to start the application:

## Developing Your Own Builder

Extending the feature-set of a ZEIT Now deployment is as simple as creating a Builder that takes a list of files and outputs either static files or dynamic [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/lambdas).

[A full API reference is available to help with creating Builders.](https://github.com/zeit/now-builders/blob/canary/DEVELOPING_A_BUILDER.md)

---

## Technical Details

### Caching Data

A builder can retain an archive of up to `100mb` of the filesystem at `build` time. The cache key is generated as a combination of:

- Project name.
- Team id or user id.
- Entrypoint path (e.g., `api/users/index.go`).
- Builder identifier including version (e.g.: `@now/go@0.0.1`).

The cache will be invalidated if any of those items changes. The user can bypass the cache by running `now -f`.

### Limits

- Builders can run for a maximum of 5 minutes before the execution times out.
- The maximum cache archive size of a Builder is 100mb.
- The cache TTL is 7 days.

### Including Additional Files

Most Builders use static analysis to determine which source files should be included in the Serverless Function output based on the build `src` input. Any unused code or assets is ignored to ensure your Serverless Function is as small as possible.

In some cases, you may wish to include templates or views that are not able to be statically analyzed. Builders provide a configuration for `includeFiles` that accepts an array of globs that will always be included in the Serverless Functions output.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@now/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": [
          "templates/**",
          "views/**"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}`}</Code>
