The ZEIT Network layer sits in-between the internet and your Now deployments.

It is responsible for many things. But the most important one is routing requests for the URL of your deployment to the correct **Lambda** or **Static File** output of your **Builds**.

## Regions

In order to route requests as fast as possible, the Network layer is running in several locations across the world. In all of these locations (called **Regions**), you can create **Deployments** that create [Builds](/docs/v2/advanced/builders) outputting [**Lambdas**](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/lambdas) and/or **Static Files** (the full list can be found [here](/docs/v2/advanced/platform/regions-and-providers)).

In turn, the Network layer will automatically forward incoming requests to the closest location in which your **Lambda** is running (**Static Files** are always distributed across the whole network, thus not location-specific).

This also means that the Network layer might forward your request to a completely different region, if the region in which it is running does not contain a **Lambda** of your **Deployment**.

### Tips

In general, we recommend distributing your **Deployments** (which contain Static Files and/or Lambdas, depending on how your Builds are configured) to **all regions**. This will improve performance drastically, as visitors are automatically served by the **Lambda** that is running closest to their location.

In order to distribute your Deployment to all **Regions** when creating it, make sure to define the `--regions` flag in [Now CLI](/download) and set it to `all`.

<Note>
  When taking advantage of this behaviour of the platform, it is very important
  to understand that Now is not resolving the keyword{' '}
  <InlineCode>all</InlineCode> to all the available regions.
</Note>

Instead, the keyword is stored as-is and instructs the platform to automatically create your **Deployments** in any other additional **Region**, should one of the existing ones experience downtime (you are not billed more for this automatic change, as the previous Region would be unreachable in that event – thus no invocations could happen).

## Additional Responsibilities

Aside from routing your requests to the correct destination, the Network layer also takes care of a few other important aspects of a working **Deployment**:

- Terminating SSL
- [Compressing your responses](/docs/v2/network/compression)

All of these actions are performed on-demand and with maximum performance (ensured by our choices of technology). In turn, we highly recommend not implementing any of those features into your own code, as it would be unnecessary.

## Supported Protocols

At the moment, we only support [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) and [WSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) (this list will be updated in the event that support for an additional protocol is added to the Network layer).
