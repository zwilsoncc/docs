[HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) can be found in both the HTTP Request and HTTP Response.

## Request Headers

The following headers are sent to each <ProductName /> deployment and can be used to process the request before sending back a response. These headers can be read from the [Request](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_headers) object in your [Serverless Function](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/).

### `host`

This header represents the domain name as it was accessed by the client. If the deployment has been assigned to a preview URL or production domain and the client visits the domain URL, it contains the custom domain instead of the underlying deployment URL.

### `x-now-id`

A unique identifier for each request.

### `x-forwarded-host`

This header is identical to the `host` header.

### `x-forwarded-proto`

This header represents the protocol of the forwarded server, typically `https` in production and `http`in development.

### `x-forwarded-for`

The public `ip address` of the client that made the request.

### `x-now-deployment-url`

This header represents the unique deployment, not the preview URL or production domain. For example, `test-5uyfnapzg.now.sh`.

### `x-now-trace`

Contains a list of [regions](/docs/v2/platform/regions/) through which the request has traversed, usually the region closest to the visitor.

<Note>
  The trace is where a request was processed, it is not necessarily where a
  Serverless Function was executed, this could be different if you defined 
  <InlineCode>regions</InlineCode> in your <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode>
   file.
</Note>

### `x-real-ip`

This header is identical to the `x-forwarded-for` header.

### `x-zeit-co-forwarded-for`

This header is identical to the `x-forwarded-for` header.

## Response Headers

The following headers are included in <ProductName /> deployment responses and indicate certain factors of the environment. These headers can be viewed from the Browser's Dev Tools or using an HTTP client such as `curl -I <DEPLOYMENT_URL>`.

### `cache-control`

Used to specify directives for caching mechanisms in both the [Network layer cache](/docs/v2/edge-network/caching/) and the browser cache. See the [Cache Control Headers](/docs/v2/edge-network/headers/#cache-control-header) section for more detail. The default value is `cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` which instructs the network layer and the browser not to cache.

### `content-length`

An integer that indicates the number of bytes in the response.

### `content-type`

The [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) that describes the nature and format of the response.

### `date`

A timestamp indicating when the response was generated.

### `server: now`

Similar to `[now: 1](/docs/v2/edge-network/headers/#now:-1)`. This header can be overridden by other proxies (e.g., Cloudflare).

### `strict-transport-security`

A header often abbreviated as [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HSTS) that tells browsers that the resource should only be requested over HTTPS. The default value is `strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000` (2 years)

### `x-now-cache`

This header's value indicates whether the response was served from <OrgName />'s edge cache.

The following values are possible when the content being served [is static](/docs/v2/edge-network/caching/#caching-static-files) or uses [a `Cache-Control` header](/docs/v2/edge-network/caching).

| Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MISS`        | The response was not found in the edge and thus fetched from an origin server.                                                                                                                                        |
| `HIT`         | The response was served from the edge.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `BYPASS`      | The cache was bypassed and so the response was served from an origin server.                                                                                                                                          |
| `STALE`       | The response is stale (served from the edge). A background request to the origin was made to get a fresh version. (see [Stale-While-Revalidate](/docs/v2/edge-network/caching/#stale-while-revalidate) for more info) |
| `REVALIDATED` | A stale response was found in the edge but revalidated synchronously due to `Pragma: no-cache`.                                                                                                                       |

### `x-now-id`

The unique identifier for each request.

### `x-now-trace`

Contains a list of [regions](/docs/v2/platform/regions/) through which the request has traversed, usually the region center closest to you.

<Note>
  The trace is where a request was processed, it is not necessarily where a
  Serverless Function was executed, this could be different if you
  defined `regions` in your `now.json` file.
</Note>

## Cache-Control Header

There are a few methods to enable the Network Layer cache with the `Cache-Control` header.

### `s-maxage`

Setting the directive to `s-maxage=60` will instruct the Network Layer to cache the response for 60 seconds. A request can be cached anywhere from 1-31,536,000 seconds (max 1 year). When `s-maxage` is set, the Network Layer strips the `s-maxage` directive and does not return it to the client.

### `stale-while-revalidate`

In addition to setting `s-maxage` the cache control directive can be combined with `stale-while-revalidate` in order to serve a stale response from the cache and update the cache in the background:

```
cache-control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate
```

This instructs the Network Layer cache to:

- Serve from the cache for 1 second.
- Return a stale request (if requested after 1 second).
- Update the cache in the background asynchronously (if requested after 1 second).

If you need to do a synchronous revalidation you can set the `pragma: no-cache` header along with the `cache-control` header. This can be used to get an idea of how long the background revalidation is taking and sets the `x-now-cache` header to `REVALIDATED`.

<Note>
  Many browser developer tools set <InlineCode>pragma: no-cache</InlineCode> by
  default, which reveals the true load time of the page with the synchronous
  update to the cache.
</Note>

## Custom Headers

Custom headers can be added dynamically to the [Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_setheader_name_value) object in your [Serverless Function](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/) or they can be added statically to the [Routes](/docs/configuration#routes/headers) property in your `now.json` file.
