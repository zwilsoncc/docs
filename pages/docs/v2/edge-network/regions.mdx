A typical server configuration might begin by selecting the region where the physical server is located. A local business would have no issue selecting the closest region to their store, but businesses with traffic spanning cities, countries, or even the entire globe might struggle to serve all their customers. This is where the <CdnName /> comes in.

## Providers

Most applications developed in the cloud only ever see one cloud. When using <ProductName />, the sky's the limit. Our CDN abstracts away cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The most exciting benefit of multi-cloud is that you do not rely solely on a single cloud provider, providing far greater reliability.

## Outage Resiliency

If an Edge Region goes down, an application's traffic gets rerouted to another Edge Region. If an Origin Region goes down, anything deployed to that Region automatically gets redeployed in a healthy Region.

To further increase our coverage and resiliency, we plan to utilize more cloud providers in the future and continue expanding our Regions.

## Routing

The <ProductName /> Platform acts as a Universal API and Overlay Network on top of existing cloud infrastructure providers.
