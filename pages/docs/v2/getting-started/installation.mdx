We officially support clients and service integrations that communicate with our [Public API](/docs/api) to enable simple deployment workflows.

Our recommendation is to install:

- [Now Desktop](#now-desktop) (which bundles [Now CLI](#now-cli)) to be able to quickly deploy while you develop and stay on top of your organization's events.
- [Now for GitHub](#now-for-github) for a first-class [GitHub](https://github.com) integration that enables [push-to-deploy](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/#a-deployment-for-each-push), [alias](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/#aliasing-the-default-branch) to a [custom domain on merge](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/adding-a-domain/), and much more.

### Now Desktop

The latest Now Desktop is available to [download from our website](/download).

Alternatively, it can be installed with [brew](https://brew.sh/):

<TerminalInput>{`brew update
brew cask install now`}</TerminalInput>

### Now CLI

The Now CLI is [open-source](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli) and distributed as binaries. It is very frequently updated and embeds helpful documentation on how to use it.

To verify it's installed and get started, run:

<TerminalInput>now help</TerminalInput>

Run the following command to log in with your ZEIT account through Now CLI:

<TerminalInput>now login</TerminalInput>

<Note>
  With <GenericLink href="#now-desktop">Now Desktop</GenericLink> installed, you
  can skip these instructions. Now CLI is packaged with Now Desktop and syncs
  login information and context between both clients. We encourage you to enable
  the option from within Now Desktop to install and keep your Now CLI up to
  date.
</Note>

#### From npm

We distribute the [Now CLI Binaries](#from-binaries) via `npm`, for convenience and ease of distribution. If you already have `npm`, which comes with Node.js, you can run:

<TerminalInput>npm i -g now</TerminalInput>

#### From Binaries

The Now CLI binaries are [available from our website](/download#now-cli) for macOS, Windows, Linux, and Alpine Linux.

These binaries do **not** need Node.js installed to run.

### Now for GitHub

Use the official Now for GitHub integration to automatically deploy each push and alias the latest iteration on the default branch.

Now for GitHub can be installed from the [account settings page](/account) as shown below:
