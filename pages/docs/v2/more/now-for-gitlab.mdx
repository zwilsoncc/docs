The Now for GitLab integration automatically deploys your GitLab projects with [ZEIT Now](/now), providing preview URLs and automatic production domain updates.

Now for GitLab provides:

- Automatic deployments for every push to branches and merge requests to preview changes live.
- Updates production domains with the most recent changes from the [default branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/#default-branch).
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes that have been made to production domains

## Set up Now for GitLab

### Step 1: Link ZEIT Now to Your GitLab Account

You can connect your Now account to GitLab by visiting your [account or team](/docs/v2/platform/users-and-teams) [settings page](/account) and clicking the "Connect with GitLab" button.

Next, you will need to authorize the Now application on GitLab with your account.

Once authorized, you will be redirected back to your ZEIT account or team settings page.

### Step 2: Link GitLab Projects

ZEIT Now only deploys GitLab projects you have explicitly linked to from the GitLab control block in your [account](/account) or team settings page, depending on where you linked your GitLab account. Without linking a project, no deployments will be made.

You can link projects across all the GitLab namespaces you have access to and unlink a project at any time.

You can also link a GitLab project from the [New Project page](/new):

## Sign Up or Login with GitLab

If you have, or will have, [connected](#step-1:-link-now-to-your-gitlab-account) your personal GitLab account to your ZEIT Now account, you can login with GitLab from our [login page](/login).

Alternatively; if you do not already have a Now account, you can sign up to ZEIT using your GitLab account from [the sign up page](/signup).

## Default Behavior

### A Deployment for Each Push

Now for GitLab will **deploy each push by default**. This includes pushes and pull requests made to branches. This allows those working within the project to preview the changes made before they are pushed to production.

With each new push, if Now is already building a previous commit, it will cancel that current build to start the most recent commit, ensuring you always have the latest changes deployed as quickly as possible.

### Updating the Production Domain

If production domains are set from the project domains dashboard, pushes and merges to the [default branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/#default-branch) (commonly "master") will be made live to those domains with the latest deployment made with a push.

If you decide to revert a commit that has already updated a product domain, the previous commit's deployment will automatically be made available at the production domain instantly; providing you with instant rollbacks.

### preview URLs for Each Merge Request

The latest push to any pull request will automatically be made available at a unique preview URL based on the project name, branch, and team or username. These URLs will be given through a comment on each merge request.

## Included Environment Variables

You may want to use different workflows and APIs based on the environment of the deployment based on Git information. To support that, ZEIT Now will deploy your app with the following built-in [environment variables](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets) when deploying with Now for GitLab:

| Variable Key                 | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITLAB_DEPLOYMENT`          | An indicator for whether the app was deployed by Now for GitLab.                        |
| `GITLAB_PROJECT_NAMESPACE`   | The GitLab user, group, or sub-group that the project belongs to.                       |
| `GITLAB_PROJECT_NAME`        | The name of the deployed project.                                                       |
| `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID`          | The ID of the deployed project.                                                         |
| `GITLAB_PROJECT_PATH`        | The GitLab project path.                                                                |
| `GITLAB_COMMIT_REF`          | The branch that the app was deployed using.                                             |
| `GITLAB_COMMIT_SHA`          | The sha of the commit the app was deployed using.                                       |
| `GITLAB_COMMIT_MESSAGE`      | The message accompanying the commit that the app was deployed using.                    |
| `GITLAB_COMMIT_AUTHOR_LOGIN` | The username belonging to the author of the commit that the project was deployed using. |
| `GITLAB_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME`  | The name belonging to the author of the commit that the project was deployed using.     |
