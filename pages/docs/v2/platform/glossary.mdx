These are the terms we encourage you to learn in order to deeply understand **Now**. However, every occurrence of one of these terms is also linked back to this very page, so that you can always jump right to the explanation if needed.

## General Terms

### Source Files

These are the files contained within your project before it is uploaded with ZEIT Now.

### Serverless Function

### Static File

### Project

A [structured group of deployments](/docs/v2/platform/projects), categorized by the deployment name.

### Apex Domain

Apex Domains are sometimes referred to as "naked", "bare", "base", "root", or "zone apex" domains.
