A deployment is the result of building your [Project](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) and making it available through a live URL.

This section contains information about making, managing, and understanding the behavior of deployments.

## Making Deployments

There are multiple ways to make deployments with ZEIT Now; these include via a [Git Integration](#git-integration), [Now CLI](#now-cli), [Deploy Hooks](#deploy-hooks), and the [Now API](#now-api).

When making deployments, the [Project](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) will be uploaded and transformed into a production-ready output through the use of a [Build Step](/docs/v2/build-step).

Once the build step has completed successfully, a new, [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) deployment will be made available at the [staging domain](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#staging).

### Git Integration

You can make deployments with Git by using either the [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-gitlab/) integrations.

When using these integrations, every push to a branch will provide you with a [staging deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#staging) to view your changes.

When merging to the default branch (commonly `master`), a [production deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#production) will be made.

### Now CLI

By using [Now CLI](/download), you can deploy [Projects](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) with **a single command** from your terminal.

To make a [staging deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#staging), use the `now` command:

<Snippet dark text="now" />
<Caption>Making a staging deployment with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

<Note>
  The first deployment for a <strong>Project</strong> is always both a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#staging">
    staging
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  and{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#production">
    production
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  deployment.
</Note>

To make a [production deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#staging), use the `now --prod` command:

<Snippet dark text="now --prod" />
<Caption>Making a production deployment with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

### Deploy Hooks

[Deploy Hooks](/docs/v2/advanced/deploy-hooks/) allow you to create URLs that accept HTTP POST requests to trigger deployments, re-running the [Build Step](/docs/v2/build-step), from outside of ZEIT.

There are many use cases for Deploy Hooks, for example, rebuilding your site to reflect changes in a Headless CMS or scheduling deployments with Cron Jobs.

To create a Deploy Hook, visit the settings page of your [Project](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) where you can choose the branch to deploy when the HTTP endpoint receives a POST request.

<Note>
  Deploy Hooks require a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/git-integration/">Git Integration</GenericLink> to
  be installed.
</Note>

You can find more information about Deploy Hooks in the [documentation](/docs/v2/advanced/deploy-hooks/).

### Now API

The [ZEIT Now API](/docs/api/) can be used to make deployments by making an HTTP POST request to the relevant endpoint, including the files you wish to deploy as the body.

You can find more information about the Now API in the [API Reference](/docs/api/#endpoints/deployments).

## Deployment Types

There are two types of deployment on the ZEIT Now platform: **staging** and **production**.

### Staging

**Staging deployments** are the default for all deployments. Each time you push to a branch or make a deployment using the `now` command, this is a **staging deployment**.

By making a **staging deployment**, the **staging domain** will be updated to reflect that of the latest deployment made.

The **staging domain** is provided either by the deployment output from Now CLI or on a pull or merge request when using a git integration and contains the name of the user or team to which the [Project](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) belongs.

### Production

**Production deployments** are made in two different circumstances. Each time you merge to the default branch (commonly `master`) or make a deployment using the `now --prod` command, this is a **production deployment**.

By making a **production deployment**, the **production domain(s)** will be updated to reflect that of the latest deployment.

The **production domain(s)** are defined from the **Domains** tab of a Project on the ZEIT Dashboard.

To add a **production domain** to a [Project](/docs/v2/platform/projects/), visit **Domains** from the Project Overview page, you can read more about this in the [custom domains documentation](/docs/v2/custom-domains/).

## Managing Deployments

You can manage your deployments either via the [ZEIT Dashboard](/dashboard) or [Now CLI](/download).

### ZEIT Dashboard

The [ZEIT Dashboard](/dashboard) is the easiest way for you to manage your deployments.

Through the ZEIT Dashboard, you can find a variety of settings; including a **Domains** tab where you can add [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains/) to your Project.

### Now CLI and API

The [Now CLI](/download) and [Now API](/docs/api/) provide alternative ways to manage your deployments.

You can find a full list of the commands available in the [Now CLI Reference](/docs/now-cli/), along with the deployments section of the [Now API Reference](/docs/api/#endpoints/deployments).

## Special Paths

All deployment URLs have two special pathnames:

- `/_src`
- `/_logs`

### Source view

By appending `/_src` to a deployment URL or [custom domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains), the deployment inspector will be open and you'll be able to browse your deployment sources and [build](/docs/v2/advanced/builders) outputs.

### Logs view

By appending `/_logs` to a deployment URL or [custom domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains), you will be able to see a realtime stream of logs from your deployment build processes and serverless invocations.

### Security considerations

These pathnames redirect to `https://zeit.co` and **require logging in** to access any sensitive information. A 3rd-party can **never** access your source or logs by crafting a deployment URL with one of these paths.
