To deploy on ZEIT Now, you need to create a **Project**. A Project is a logical structure that groups [deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains). Each project can be associated to a [GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-bitbucket) repository.

## Creating a Project

You can create a new project from the ZEIT Dashboard by clicking on [the New Project button](/new).

You can either [import from an existing Git repository](/docs/v2/git-integrations) or use one of our templates.

## Project Settings

To edit project settings, choose a project from the [dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard):

### Build & Development Settings and Root Directory

You can edit build and development settings as well as the root directory settings. Check out [our Build Step documentation](/docs/v2/build-step) to learm more.

### Logs and Source Access

If you turn on **Logs and Source Access**, the following paths for your project will be publicly accessible. Even if this setting is off, you can still access these paths by logging in.

- `/_src`: Displays the source code and build output.
- `/_logs`: Displays the build logs.

<Note type="warning">
  Do not edit this setting if you don’t want your source code or logs to be
  publicly accessible.
</Note>

#### Ony applied starting from your next deployment

As with other project settings, the changes you make to this setting will only be applied starting from your **next deployment**.

<Note>
  When you toggle this setting, none of your existing deployments will be
  affected. If you’d like to make the source code or logs private on your
  existing deployments, the only option is to delete them.
</Note>

### Deploy Hooks

ZEIT Now supports **deploy hooks**, which are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests and trigger deployments. Check out [our Deploy Hooks documentation](/docs/v2/more/deploy-hooks) to learn more.

### Custom Domains

You can add **custom domains** for each project. Check out [our Custom Domains documentation](/docs/v2/custom-domains) to learn more.

## Deleting a Project

<Note type="warning">
  Deleting your project will also delete the deployments and domains within it.
  If you have any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not
  want them to be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom
  domain under a different project first.
</Note>

To delete a project, choose a project from the [dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard):
