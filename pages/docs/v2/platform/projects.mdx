A Project is a logical structure that groups [deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains) inside of an account or team, based on the name of the project. This structure allows easier tracking and managing of deployments.

The Projects structure enables faster locating of [deployments logs](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#logs-view), [source code](/docs/v2/platform/deployments/#source-view), and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains).

## Creating a Project

Projects are automatically created when making a deployment using the name of the repository connected with a [ZEIT Now for Git Integration](/docs/v2/git-integrations).

You can import your existing project from the ["Create a new project"](/import) section of the ZEIT Dashboard. If you do not have an existing project, this page also allows you to get started from a template.

If you would like your Project to be created with a name different to that of the repository, you can include a configuration file and use the [name property](/docs/configuration#project/name).

## Deleting a Project

You can remove a project and all of the deployments contained within it by navigation to your project from your dashboard, followed by its settings tab.

<Note type="warning" label="Note">
  Deleting your project will also delete the deployments within it. If you have
  any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not want them to
  be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom domain under a
  different project first.
