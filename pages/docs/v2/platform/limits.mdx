This page outlines all relevant limits and limitations present when using the <ProductName /> platform.

## General Limits

To prevent abuse of our platform, we apply the following limits to all accounts.

<br />

|                                        | Hobby | Pro  | Enterprise |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| Deployments (per day)                  | 100   | 3000 | Custom     |
| Serverless Functions per Deployment    | 12    | 24   | Custom     |
| Serverless Functions per Month         | 160   | 640  | Custom     |
| Serverless Function Duration (Seconds) | 10    | 60   | 900        |
| Deployments created from CLI per week  | 2000  | 2000 | Custom     |
| Team members per Team                  | -     | 10   | Custom     |

<Note>
  Next.js Static Site Generation and Next.js Preview Serverless Functions are
  excluded from the count for "Serverless Functions per Deployment".
</Note>

## Logs

All log types - **Build Time**, **Edge Network**, and **Runtime** - have differing behavior when it comes to storing logs.

During the [Build Step](/docs/v2/platform/glossary#build-step), the last 2,000 log lines are stored and persisted.

For [Edge Network requests](/docs/v2/edge-network/regions#automatic-edge-cdn), all logs are **not persisted**.

For [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/), only logs from failed requests are **persisted**.

All other logs are stored in memory only and are **not persisted** between page views. Each log output is **limited to 4kb**. For log outputs greater than 4kb per Serverless Function invocation, only the last 4kb will be retained.

## Environment Variables

The maximum number of [Environment Variables](/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables) per Environment per [Project](/docs/v2/platform/glossary#project)
is **100**. For example, you can not have more than 100 Production Environment Variables.

Moreover, the total size of [Environment Variables](/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables) applied to a Deployment
(including all the Environment Variables Names and Values) is **limited to 4kb**. [Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments)
made with Environment Variables exceeding the 4kb limit will fail during the [Build Step](/docs/v2/build-step/).

## Domains

The maximum amount of domains that can be applied to a single project is **50**. If your Project requires more than 50 domains, please <EmailLink type="sales">contact our enterprise team</EmailLink>.

## Files

The maximum number of files that can be uploaded when making a [deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments) is **10,000** for source files and **16,000** for build output files.

Deployments made that contain more files than the limit will fail at the [build step](/docs/v2/build-step/).

## HTTP/2 Push

The <ProductName /> platform does not currently support HTTP/2 Push.

## WebSockets

[Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) do not support WebSockets.

Instead of pushing data, you can intelligently fetch data on-demand. For example, the <ProductName /> dashboard delivers real-time updates using [SWR](https://swr.now.sh).

If you need persistent connections to push data to the client, consider using third party pub/sub services. See the [Pusher Channels Guide](/guides/deploying-pusher-channels-with-zeit-now) for an example.

## SMTP

For security reasons, the <ProductName /> platform blocks outgoing SMTP connections.

As a result of this, we recommend using a third-party service to enable email functionality for [deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments).

## Serverless Function Size

The maximum size for a [Serverless Function](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) is **50 MB**.

You can configure [functions](/docs/configuration#project/functions) with `includeFiles` and `excludeFiles` which may affect the function size, however the limit cannot be configured.

## Serverless Function Memory

The maximum memory size for a [Serverless Function](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) deployed on a personal account (Hobby plan) is **1024 MB**. For teams (Pro plan), it can be increased to up to **3008 MB**.

You can use the [functions](/docs/configuration#project/functions) property to adjust the memory size for each Serverless Function.

## Serverless Function Concurrency

The maximum number of concurrent executions for a [Serverless Function](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/) is `1000`.

If you require a limit above `1000`, you should <EmailLink type="sales">contact our enterprise team</EmailLink> to discuss custom limits available on an enterprise plan.

## Serverless Function Payload Size Limit

The maximum payload size for the request body or the response body of a [Serverless Function](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/) is **5MB**.

If a Serverless Function receives a payload in excess of the limit it will return an error - **413: FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE**.

## Serverless Function Regions

It is possible to deploy [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/) to multiple regions, however this featured is limited to [Enterprise plans](/pricing). See also the [FAQ section](/docs/v2/platform/frequently-asked-questions#deploying-serverless-functions-to-multiple-regions) for more details on the Pro plan.

When attempting to deploy Serverless Functions to multiple regions on a non-Enterprise plan, the deployment will fail before entering the [build step](/docs/v2/build-step/).

## Streaming Responses

â€‹<ProductName /> does not support streaming responses from Serverless Functions due to an upstream limitation from AWS.

This means that background tasks, also known as "fire-and-forget" is not supported. Once the function returns the response payload, it stops processing including any pending background tasks.

## Reserved Variables

The following environment variable names are [reserved](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#lambda-environment-variables) and therefore unavailable for use:

- Names starting with `VERCEL_`
- Names starting with `NOW_`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`
- `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`
- `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`
- `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`
- `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`
- `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- `NOW_REGION`
- `TZ`
- `_HANDLER`
- `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`
- `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_DIR`

[Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments) made that use any of the reserved variable names will fail at the [build step](/docs/v2/build-step/).

## Rate Limits

**Rate limits** are hard limits that apply to the platform when performing actions that require a response from an API.

The **rate limits** table consists of the following four columns:

- **Description** - A brief summary of the limit which, where relevant, will advise what type of plan it applies to.
- **Limit** - The amount of actions permitted within the amount of time (**Duration**) specified.
- **Duration** - The amount of time (seconds) in which you can perform the specified amount of actions. Once a rate limit is hit, it will be reset after the **Duration** has expired.
- **Scope** - Who the limit applies to, `owner` refers to the account owner, `user` refers to an individual user on a **Team** account.

## Examples

Below are three examples that provide further information on how the rate limits work.

### Domain Deletion

Taking the domains deletion rate limit as an example, you are allowed to delete up to `60` domains every `60` seconds (1 minute). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another minute before deleting another domain.

### Team Deletion

With the team deletion rate limit, you are able to delete up to `20` teams every `3600` seconds (1 hour). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another hour before deleting another team.

### Username Update

For the username update rate limit, you are able to change your username up to `6` times every `604800` seconds (1 week). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another week before changing your username again.
