The ZEIT Now Platform comprises our API, clients and routing layer. All the individual components are designed to work together in cohesion according to the _platform version_.

## Versioning

There exist two major platform versions of ZEIT Now:

- **1.0** (**legacy**).
- **2.0** (**default** as of **08-11-2018**).

As of **2.0**, there is no longer a concept of deployment **types**. All deployments can combine static and dynamic serverless entrypoints.

We recommend migrating to v2 for increased performance, security and new features by following our [upgrade guide](/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/).

<Note>
  As of the 4th of January 2019, all new users will no longer be able to create
  deployments on the Now 1.0 platform version.
</Note>

## Version Selection

All individual accounts and teams are always automatically on the latest default version of the platform if created on or after 29-10-2018**.**

If you already had an account, we recommend upgrading your default version to **latest**, this can be done in the Settings page from your account dashboard.

### Team or Account Versioning

In our web dashboard, head to Settings by clicking on your profile picture while logged-in.

<Note>
  please make sure to do this for each <b>context</b> you are interested in
  selecting a version for (i.e.: individual and/or teams).
</Note>

If you created your account before 29-10-2018, you will be in the **1.0 legacy platform**. Otherwise, you'll always be on the **latest** (2.0 as of now). We recommend upgrading to v2 once you are confident you have [upgraded your projects](/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/).
