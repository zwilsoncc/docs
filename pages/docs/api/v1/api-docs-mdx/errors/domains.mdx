These error code could happen when using any [domains related endpoints](#endpoints/domains).

### Domain Forbidden

      "message": "Domain name not found"
    }
  }`}</Code>

### Missing Domain Name

The domain name wasn't specified in the URL. This means you tried to use an endpoint which require you to define the domain name in the URL but didn't defined it.
