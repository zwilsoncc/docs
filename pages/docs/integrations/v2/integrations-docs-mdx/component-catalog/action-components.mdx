## Action Components

These components create a new UIHook request with an action that forms part of the component.

### Button

This is a key part of your UIHook. When the user clicks the button, we call your UIHook with the action attached to the button.

```jsx
<Button action="create-db">Create Database</Button>
```

The Button component supports the following attributes:

- `small`
- `disabled`
- `width` (in pixels)
- `secondary`
- `warning`
- `highlight`
- `abort`

### ProjectSwitcher

This component can be used when you want to provide your users with a way of switching between projects easily, or if you require them to select a project to start using your Integration initially.

```jsx
<ProjectSwitcher message="Choose a project from the list" />
```

The ProjectSwitcher component supports the following attribute:

- `message` (default is `"Select a project"`)

### AutoRefresh

This can be use to refresh the UI by loading the UIHook again. This is useful when waiting for a background task to finish processing.

```jsx
<AutoRefresh timeout="<timeout-in-millis>" />
```

<Note>Timeouts must be greater than 3 seconds.</Note>

The AutoRefresh component supports the following attributes:

- `action`
- `timeout`

### Link

The Link component allows you to link to either an external URL or an action:

```jsx
<Link href="https://zeit.co">Visit ZEIT</Link>
```

```jsx
<Link action="doSomething">Do Something</Link>
```

The Link component supports the following attribute:

- `target`

### Select

The Select component provides the user with a dropdown menu that contains specified options.
By default, this is an [input component](/docs/integrations#component-catalog/input-components),
however, adding the `action` attribute, the component can be converted into an [action](#component-catalog/action-components) component.

When using the `action` attribute, when a user selects an option from the element, the UIHook will be called again containing the defined action within the [client state](#creating-user-interfaces/client-state).

```jsx
<Select name="dbName" value="selectedValue" action="change-db">
  <Option value="mongodb" caption="MongoDB" />
  <Option value="redis" caption="Redis" />
</Select>
```
