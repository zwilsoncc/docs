## UIHooks are HTTP-Based

UIHooks are HTTP based, therefore they are not tied to any programming language or framework.

The process a UIHook uses is as follows:

- The UIHook receives a HTTP POST request, including a JSON payload as the request body
- The UIHook returns a HTML string, with [components](#component-catalog), as the response
- A UIHook can be called via client side, so it needs to support CORS

The following example shows how you can implement a UIHook with Node.js and [micro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micro).

<Note>
  This implementation is very similar to implementations in other languages.
</Note>

```js
const micro = require('micro')

let counter = 0

async function uiHook(req, res) {
  // Add CORS support. So UIHook can be called via client side.
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS')
  res.setHeader(
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers',
    'Authorization, Accept, Content-Type'
  )

  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    return micro.send(res, 200)
  }

  // UIHook works only with HTTP POST.
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return micro.send(res, 404, '404 - Not Found')
  }

  // Extract payload from the POST body.
  const payload = await micro.json(req)
  if (payload.action === 'reset') {
    counter = 0
  } else {
    counter += 1
  }

  // Send HTML, with components, as the response
  return micro.send(
    res,
    200,
    `
    <Page>
      <P>Counter: ${counter}</P>
      <Button>Count Me</Button>
      <Button action="reset">Reset</Button>
    </Page>
  `
  )
}

// Start the HTTP server
const server = micro(uiHook)
const port = process.env.PORT || 5005

console.log(`UIHook started on http://localhost:${port}`)
server.listen(port, err => {
  if (err) {
    throw err
  }
})
```
