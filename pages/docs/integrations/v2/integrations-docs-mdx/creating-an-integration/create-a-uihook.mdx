## Step 2: Creating a UIHook

This step will detail the creation of a UIHook for a counter application. This example explains the basics for how an UIHook works.

First, create an `index.js` file and add the following code:

```js
const { withUiHook } = require('@zeit/integration-utils')

let count = 0

module.exports = withUiHook(({ payload }) => {
  count += 1
  return `
    <Page>
      <P>Counter: ${count}</P>
      <Button>Count Me</Button>
    </Page>
  `
})
```

<Caption>

Inside the [UIHook](/docs/integrations#understanding-uihooks) there is a variable, `count`. Every time the [Button](#component-catalog/action-components/button) is clicked, the UIHook is called, thus updating the counter and **providing the updated HTML as a response**.

This is happening inside the ZEIT Dashboard under a configuration page for this Integration.

### Running the UIHook Locally

With the [help of `now dev`](/docs/v2/development/basics), you can run your UIHook locally inside a **simulation of the Now platform**.

By running your UIHook locally, you can test that your Integration, after creating the Integration with ZEIT, behaves as expected before deploying your Integration to production. This will be explored further in the next section.

To run the UIHook locally, use the following command:

<TerminalInput>now dev -p 5005</TerminalInput>
