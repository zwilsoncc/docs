Logs are important because it allows you to see what's happening inside the app, especially when a crisis happens. <ProductShortV1Name /> keeps logs of all of your deployments and allows you to search them.

Let's have a look at how you can access logs.

## Via CLI

Accessing logs via the `now` CLI is simple as invoking this command:

<TerminalInput>now logs [deployment-url]</TerminalInput>

You can also use the domain name of your app to search logs:

<TerminalInput>now logs my-web-app.com</TerminalInput>

For more information on `now logs`, run the help command with:

<TerminalInput>now logs --help</TerminalInput>

Here's an advanced `now logs` command to let you inspect the last 10 HTTP GET requests.

<TerminalInput>now logs -a -q "GET" -n 10 my-web-app.com</TerminalInput>

## Via Dashboard

You can also access and search logs via your web dashboard at <https://vercel.com/dashboard>.<br/>
Click any of your deployment URLs inside the dashboard and start searching logs.

> You may need to click the "Logs" link on the header (top right) to see logs.
