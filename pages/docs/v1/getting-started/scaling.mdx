Deploying an app is just the start. We need to scale our app as our user base grows. It could be a linear growth or random spikes in certain times.

Either way, we need to make sure our app is running smoothly as the traffic increases. All the <ProductShortV1Name /> deployments are backed by "auto scaling ready" infrastructure. So, you are in good hands.

## Basics

Each of your <ProductShortV1Name /> deployment consists of zero or few instances. An instance is a running version of your deployment. <ProductShortV1Name /> can clone and run new instances as needed and kill them if they are not needed.

Each deployment has a minimum and maximum amount of instances it can have. Based on that we can scale our app as needed.

## Default Scaling

By default, all of the deployments are configured like this:

- min: 0
- max: auto

This means, when your deployment receives some traffic <ProductShortV1Name /> will start an instance. If your deployment doesn't receive any traffic for a while, <ProductShortV1Name /> will kill that instance.

With this configuration, your deployment will scale to up to 10 instances automatically, depending on the incoming traffic load.

_Having older deployments which are **not active** will cost you nothing._

## Fixed Scaling

As your user base grows, your app could be slower to respond. Because it tries to serve more requests than it could do.

To resolve this issue, you can scale your app to run a fixed number of instances and they'll run forever.

Here's how you can do that:

<TerminalInput>now scale hello-node-lwbxweoqjo.now.sh 3</TerminalInput>

In this case, <ProductShortV1Name /> will set the `min` and `max` instance settings to 3.

### With `now alias`

Here, `hello-node-lwbxweoqjo.now.sh` is one of our deployment URL. Instead, you can scale a "domain name" you mapped with `now alias`.

For an example:

<TerminalInput>now scale hnode.now.sh 3</TerminalInput>

Then it'll scale the deployment behind the alias. (in this case, the alias is `hnode.now.sh`).

If you run `now alias` again, it'll scale the new deployment accordingly and scale down the old deployment to the <Link href="/docs/getting-started/scaling#default-scaling">default scaling setup</Link>.

## Auto Scaling

Sometimes, your app may receive sudden traffic spikes and it's pretty hard to predict the pattern. Then you need to scale your app based on the traffic. To do that, you can turn on “auto scaling” by using different `min` and `max` instance values.

> You need to have [the "Pro" plan or a higher plan](/pricing/v1) to do "auto scaling"

Here's how to auto scale an app with the URL `hnode.now.sh`

<TerminalInput>now scale hnode.now.sh 2 15</TerminalInput>

Now the deployment behind `hnode.now.sh` runs with a minimum of 2 instances and it can scale up to 15 instances as the traffic increases.

​<ProductShortV1Name /> will automatically start and kill instances based on the traffic `hnode.now.sh` receives.

## Static Deployments

All the static deployments are infinitely scalable and they are auto scaled by default on all plans.
So, you don't need to invoke `now scale` for static deployments.
