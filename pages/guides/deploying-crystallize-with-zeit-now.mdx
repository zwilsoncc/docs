[Crystallize](https://crystallize.com/) is a super-fast GraphQL based headless e-commerce service with super structured product information management.

In this guide, you will discover how to create a [Crystallize e-commerce site](https://crystallize.now-examples.now.sh/), that uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process payments, and deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/now).

## Step 1: Creating Your API Keys

Create a [Crystallize account](https://crystallize.com/signup). From the Crystallize dashboard, open the menu and select **Settings** then **Access tokens**.

Enter a name and create your token, you will be provided with both an `access-token-id` and an `access-token-secret`. You will not be shown these again, so keep the window open until you have used them in [Step 2](#step-2:set-up-your-crystallize-project).

If you do not already have one, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register). From the Stripe dashboard, locate your API keys from the **Developers** link, you will need both the **Publishable** and **Secret** keys.

Once both sets of keys are available, you can move on to creating your Crystallize project.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Crystallize Project

[Set up a Crystallize project](https://crystallize.com/developers) with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and move into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npx @crystallize/cli my-crystallize-project && cd my-crystallize-project" />
<Caption>Initializing a Crystallize project with <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx</Link> and moving into the project directory.</Caption>

During the setup, you will be asked a series of questions that will customize the output. Select the following options:

- Teddy bear shop
- Next.js + React
- **Both** ZEIT Now and a payment method
- Stripe
- Configure tokens and API keys now

<Note>
  To select Stripe, navigate using the arrow keys and use the spacebar to select
  before pressing enter to confirm.
</Note>

Once you have selected these options, you will be asked to enter the API keys obtained in [Step 1](#step-1:creating-your-api-keys). Enter the information requested, after this has been completed, you no longer need to access the keys directly from either Crystallize or Stripe.

## Step 3: Adding Your API Keys as Now Secrets

Using [Now CLI](/download), create [Now Secrets](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/) to securely store the API keys received. You can find these in the `.env` file created by the project setup in [Step 2](#step-2:set-up-your-crystallize-project).

## Step 4: Deploying Your Crystallize Site with ZEIT Now

With a Crystallize site set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

Using [Now CLI](/download), deploy your e-commerce store with **a single command**:

If you want to deploy your Crystallize project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
