Vue.js is an open source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is popularly known for its gentle learning curve and is adopted by a lot of developers for crafting single-page applications (SPAs) globally.

In this guide, we will cover how to deploy a Vue.js application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Vue.js Project

First, set up a Vue.js project using the [official Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) to quickly scaffold a batteries-included Vue.js SPA.

If you don't have the Vue CLI installed globally, use the following command to install it globally:

<TerminalInput>yarn global add @vue/cli</TerminalInput>

After a successful installation, create a new project and `cd` into the project folder. Use the following command in your terminal to do so:

<TerminalInput>vue create vue-project && cd vue-project</TerminalInput>

An option to choose a preset will be presented to you after running the command above.

After choosing an option, Vue CLI installs all the required dependencies and provisions a new project for you.

To get started with developing your Vue project locally, enter the following command:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>

  command.
</Caption>

Next, to extend the project with client-side routing; install the [official Vue.js router](https://router.vuejs.org/) by running the following command in your terminal:

<TerminalInput>vue add router</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing the Vue.js router with Vue CLI.</Caption>

Vue CLI adds the router to the project and automatically updates the project files with basic routing functionality.

## Step 2: Deploying with Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Vue.js app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

Just like local development with `now dev`, you can deploy your Vue.js application with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following: <https://my-vue-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/>

You can see that routes were successful by going to the generated `/about` route directly: <https://my-vue-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/about>
