Vue.js is an open source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is popularly known for its gentle learning curve and is adopted by a lot of developers for crafting single-page applications (SPAs) globally.

In this guide, we will cover how to deploy a Vue.js application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Vue.js Project

First, set up a Vue.js project using the [official Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) to quickly scaffold a batteries-included Vue.js SPA.

If you don't have the Vue CLI installed globally, use the following command to install it globally:

<TerminalInput>yarn global add @vue/cli</TerminalInput>

After a successful installation, create a new project and `cd` into the project folder. Use the following command in your terminal to do so:

<TerminalInput>vue create vue-project && cd vue-project</TerminalInput>

An option to choose a preset will be presented to you after running the command above.

After choosing an option, Vue CLI installs all the required dependencies and provisions a new project for you.

To see your new Vue.js project running, you can use the following command to start a development server locally:

<TerminalInput>yarn serve</TerminalInput>

Next, to extend the project with routing; install the [official Vue.js router](https://router.vuejs.org/) by running the following command in your terminal:

<TerminalInput>vue add router</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing the Vue.js router with Vue CLI.</Caption>

Vue CLI adds the router to the project and automatically updates the project files with basic routing functionality.

## Step 2: Deploy Your Vue.js Project to Now

After your project is set up, you are ready to deploy your Vue.js app to Now.

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

For the deployment to build and act as you would expect, you need to create a [`now.json` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) file to instruct Now on how to build the project with a `build` step.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-vue-project",
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "^/js/(.*)", "dest": "/js/$1" },
    { "src": "^/css/(.*)", "dest": "/css/$1" },
    { "src": "^/img/(.*)", "dest": "/img/$1" },
    { "src": ".*", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

This `now.json` file achieves a few things:

- Defines a `version` property to ensure you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version.
- Defines a project `name` that your deployments will be sorted under and known by under Now.
- Defines a `builds` property as an array with one build step using `@now/static-build` to instruct Now to statically build the project and deploy the `dist` directory. Using the `package.json` file as an entrypoint, more on that below.
- Defines a `routes` property as an array that contains `route` objects to route all files under the `js`, `css`, and `img` directories to the right place whilst providing a fallback to `index.html` for all other routes so that Vue.js can handle routing internally.

For the build property that you configured, add a `now-build` script in the generated `package.json` file to specify what command Now will run to build the app in the cloud.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "build": "vue-cli-service build",
      "now-build": "vue-cli-service build"
    },
}
```

`yarn build` creates a directory called `dist` which Now identifies as the static folder by default and will deploy it.

<Note>
  Don't forget to exclude the <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> folder from
  being uploaded to Now to enable faster deployment. To do that, add a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/guides/prevent-uploading-sourcepaths-with-nowignore/">
    .nowignore
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  file to the root of the project directory and add{' '}
  <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> to it.
</Note>

You are now ready to deploy the app with Now:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following: https://my-vue-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/

You can see that our routes were successful by going to the generated `/about` route directly: https://my-vue-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/about

## Bonus: Cache Your Vue.js Assets

Caching your sites is essential for serving fast and highly performant sites to your users. Thankfully, you can configure Now's routes within your `now.json` configuration file to set up caching headers.

In the `now.json` configuration file, modify the existing `routes` property with [cache-control headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control):

```json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "^/js/(.*)", "headers": {"cache-control": "max-age=31536000,immutable"}, "dest": "/js/$1"},
    {"src": "^/css/(.*)", "headers": {"cache-control": "max-age=31536000,immutable"}, "dest": "/css/$1"},
    {"src": "^/img/(.*)", "headers": {"cache-control": "max-age=31536000,immutable"}, "dest": "/img/$1"},
    {"src": ".*", "headers": {"cache-control": "max-age=0,must-revalidate"}, "dest": "/index.html"}
  ]
}
```
