[<ProductName />](/) supports configuration required to ignore source files and paths within your project. With a `.vercelignore` file in your project directory, a source path can be prevented from being uploaded to <ProductName />.

## File Syntax

The syntax of a `.vercelignore` file matches that of the popular [`.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) used in ignoring files when uploading to a Git repository.

An example of a `.vercelignore` file that prevents an `/image` directory and `/private.html` file within a project from being uploaded to <ProductName /> would look like this:

```
image
private.html
```

## Allowlist

A typical `.vercelignore` file assumes all files are allowed and each entry is a pattern to ignore. Alternatively, you may chose to ignore all files and each entry is a pattern to allow.
The first step is to add a wildcard `/*` as the first line in `.vercelignore`. This will ensure all directories and files in the project root are ignored. The following lines must start with a `!` to invert the ignore action and ensure the directory or file is allowed.

```
# Ignore everything (folders and files) on root only
/*
!api
!vercel.json
!*.html
```

## Uploaded Files

Aside from the [default exclusions](/docs/v2/build-step/#ignored-files-and-folders), all files within your project are uploaded to <ProductName /> if no source path is specified to be excluded in a [`.vercelignore` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths).

    <ProductName /> documentation
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

Worthy of note is that not all uploaded files are served on <ProductName />. So, what files are served?

## Served Files

If [<ProductName />](/) is required to build your project, the non-targeted files are prevented from being deployed and served on <ProductName />.

The use of a `.vercelignore` configuration file allows you to keep private files safe and also makes your deployment faster by uploading only the essential files.
