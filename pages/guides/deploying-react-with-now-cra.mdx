[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Facebook, for easily creating interactive [single-page apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs).

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a React app with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) (CRA) and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your React Project

Get started by setting up a React app using the [Create React App (CRA)](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) CLI tool. With this, you can generate a project to get up and running with React.

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), you can setup a React app with CRA with the following command in your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="npm init react-app my-react-app && cd my-react-app" />

If you would prefer to use another method, see the [Quick Start documentation for CRA](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started#quick-start).

## Step 2: Deploying Your React Project with ZEIT Now

With your React application set up, it is ready to deploy with [Now](/docs/v2).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

To deploy your React project, use the following [Now CLI](/download) command from your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your React project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
