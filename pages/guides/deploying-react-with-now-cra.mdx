React is a popular open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Facebook, for easily creating interactive single-page applications (SPAs).

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a React application with Create React App and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your React Project

An easy way to set up a React application is to use [Create React App (CRA)](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/). A CLI tool that helps generate a project for you to get up and go without any manual set up.

A fast method of setting up with CRA is to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) in your terminal. The following command helps use CRA without installing it permanently on your system. The command will also move you into the directory:

<TerminalInput>yarn create react-app my-react-app && cd my-react-app</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Bootstrapping a React application with Create React App through Yarn.</Caption>

If you would prefer to use another method, see the [Quick Start documentation for CRA](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started#quick-start).

Once you have set up a React project with Create React App, you will be presented with information, one piece of which will tell you that you can now start your local development server with the following command:

<TerminalInput>yarn start</TerminalInput>

You can now start developing your React application while testing it on your local server.

## Step 2: Deploy Your React Project with Now

With your React project set up, you are ready to deploy your app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

For the deployment to build and act as you would expect, you will need to create a [`now.json` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) to instruct Now on how to handle your application in the build phase and when being served to visitors.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=31536000,immutable" },
      "dest": "/static/$1"
    },
    { "src": "/favicon.ico", "dest": "/favicon.ico" },
    { "src": "/asset-manifest.json", "dest": "/asset-manifest.json" },
    { "src": "/manifest.json", "dest": "/manifest.json" },
    { "src": "/precache-manifest.(.*)", "dest": "/precache-manifest.$1" },
    {
      "src": "/service-worker.js",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=0" },
      "dest": "/service-worker.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=0" },
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

  static-build Builder and routes for a React application.

The above `now.json` file may look daunting, but it achieves a lot in a very simple way:

- Defines a `version` property to ensure you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version.
- Defines a project `name` that your deployments will be sorted under and known by under Now.
- Defines a `builds` property as an array with one build step using `@now/static-build` to instruct Now to statically build the project and deploy the `build` directory. Using the `package.json` file as an entrypoint, [more on that below](#build-instruction).
- Defines a `routes` property as an array that contains `route` objects to route all files to the right place whilst providing a fallback to `index.html` for all other routes so that React can handle routing and pages internally.

### Caching React with Now Routes

The `routes` option above also contains headers for [caching](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/routing/caching/). All files in the `static` directory are cached forever in a shared cache because they have a hash assigned to them on generation. Both `service-worker.js` and `index.html` are never cached since they must always serve fresh content.

### Build Instruction

For the build property that you configured, add a `now-build` script in the generated `package.json` file to specify what command Now will run to build the app in the cloud.

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "build": "react-scripts build",
      "now-build": "react-scripts build"
    }
}
```

<Caption>

  React.
</Caption>

The CRA generated `build` script creates a directory called `build` which Now identifies as the static folder through the `distDir` configuration option, which you provided to the builder in the `now.json` configuration, and will deploy that directory.

<Note>
  Don't forget to exclude the <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> folder from
  being uploaded to Now to enable faster deployment. To do that, add a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/guides/prevent-uploading-sourcepaths-with-nowignore/">
    .nowignore
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  file to the root of the project directory and add{' '}
  <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> to it.
</Note>

You are now ready to deploy the app with Now:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following: https://my-cra-project-4rx7b16z3.now.sh
