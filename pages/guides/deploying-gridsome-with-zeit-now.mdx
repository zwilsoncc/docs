[Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) is an open source Vue.js site generator which gives developers the power to build sites that are fast by default.

In this guide, you will discover how to create a Gridsome site and deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/now).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Gridsome Project

Set up a Gridsome project using the [Gridsome CLI](https://gridsome.org/docs/gridsome-cli/#gridsome-cli) and move into the project directory.

<Snippet dark text="gridsome create gridsome-project && cd gridsome-project" />

## Step 2: Deploying Your Gridsome Project with ZEIT Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Gridsome site with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can deploy your Gridsome site with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Gridsome project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
