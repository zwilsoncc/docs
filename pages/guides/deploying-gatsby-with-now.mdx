[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) is a popular front-end framework that helps you create static apps and websites with React.

In this guide, we will show how you can set up your Gatsby project and deploy with Now in a few moments.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Gatsby Project

If you have not already [set up a Gatsby project](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start) you can do so by first installing Gatsby CLI globally from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>yarn global add gatsby-cli</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing <GenericLink href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/">gatsby-cli</GenericLink> globally with <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</GenericLink>.</Caption>

Then you can run the following command to create a Gatsby project locally:

<TerminalInput>gatsby new my-gatsby-project</TerminalInput>

At this point you you add a `now-dev` script to your `package.json` file. This will allow you to [replicate the Now environment locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/):

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "now-dev": "gatsby develop -p $PORT",
  }
}
```

The [`@now/static-build` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#local-development) supports a custom `now-dev` script that allows you to define [custom development behavior](/docs/v2/development/basics/#custom-development-environment) while gaining extra features that mimic the Now platform locally.

To run your project locally, all that's required is a **single command**:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>

## Step 2: Deploying Your Gatsby Website with Now

With a Gatsby application set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

First, you need to provide Now with instructions on how to build your Gatsby project using [a `now.json` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration):

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-gatsby-project",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "public" }
    }
  ]
}
```

This now.json file will allow your deployment to do several things, specifically:

- Use the [latest Now 2.0 version](/docs/v2/platform/overview/#versioning) of the platform.
- Set [the project name](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#name) to "my-gatsby-project".
- Use [the @now/static-build Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build) to take the `package.json` file as an entrypoint and use the `public` directory as your content directory.

The @now/static-build Builder you added requires a script to be included in the `package.json` you provided as the entrypoint. This script can be added to the end of the array of scripts that Gatsby CLI created for us as you did earlier with `now-dev`:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "now-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file.

And with configuration set up, you can now deploy your Gatsby project.

If you have Now CLI on your system, you can deploy from your terminal with just one command:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you want to deploy your Gatsby project when you push to a GitHub repository, you can use Now for GitHub to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.

When your app has been deployed, you will receive a URL similar to the following: <https://my-gatsby-project-fp9racotj.now.sh/>

## Bonus: Cache Your Gatsby Assets

Caching is a key part of making your websites fast for users, new and returning. With this in mind, Now's routes configuration allows you to set up caching headers easily.

The Gatsby documentation has [recommended cache control values](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/caching/#caching) which we will use for our [routes configuration](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#routes). Since Now will cache all static assets for one year without any configuration, we just need to tell the platform to avoid caching of HTML pages.

In the `now.json` configuration file, add the following `routes` property:

```json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "^/(.*).html", "headers": {"cache-control": "public,max-age=0,must-revalidate"}, "dest": "$1.html" }
  ]
}
```
