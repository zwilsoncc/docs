[Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) is a family of responsive front-end frameworks that make it easy to design beautiful responsive websites, apps and emails that look amazing on any device.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Foundation Project

Set up a Foundation app with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and move into the project directory, choosing the option **A web app** and providing a project name of `my-foundation-app`:

<Snippet dark text="npx foundation new && cd my-foundation-app" />
<Caption>Initializing a Foundation app with <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx</Link> and moving into the project directory.</Caption>

In the `./my-foundation-app/config.yml` file, under the `PATHS` object, change the output directory for the project to `public`:

```diff
PATHS:
-   "dist": "dist"
+   "dist": "public"
```

## Step 2: Deploying Your Foundation App with ZEIT Now

With a Foundation app set up, it is ready to deploy live with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

Using [Now CLI](/download), deploy your app with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Foundation app when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [ZEIT Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/more/now-for-github), [ZEIT Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/more/now-for-gitlab), or [ZEIT Now for Bitbucket](/docs/v2/more/now-for-bitbucket) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
