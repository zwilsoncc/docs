In this guide, you will discover how to create a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that displays links to posts from the [ZEIT blog](/blog) by utilizing the [ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/) content management system, before deploying **with just a single command** to [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) from [ZEIT](https://zeit.co) is a **production-ready framework** that helps you create fast React applications. [ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/) is a drop-in headless CMS with zero headaches that allows you to **never worry about hosting, upgrades, uptime, security or performance** whilst storing all your content in one place.

By following this guide, you will create a clone of the [example app](https://nextjs-buttercms.now-examples.now.sh/), a starting point to get you up and running with your own Next.js + ButterCMS app in minutes.

## Step 1: Create your ButterCMS Content

From your [ButterCMS Collections dashboard](https://buttercms.com/content/collections/), create a new **Collection** called **Posts** by clicking the **+ New Collection** button.

Add the following fields to your **Collection**, all of type **Short Text**, by clicking the **Add New Property** button:

- `title`
- `date`
- `alt`
- `image`
- `url`

Your **Posts Collection** should look like this:

  width={650}
  height={255}
  oversize
/>

Next, click the **+ Add to Posts** button to create a post, providing the relevant details.

That's it for creating content! You can edit both the **Posts Collection** and its content at any time, either by adding or removing **Posts** or changing the **Collection Item Properties**.

Next, select **Settings** from the account dropdown menu at the top left of the screen. Here you will find your **Read API Token**, make a note of this so you can use it later on in your app.

## Step 2: Creating your Next.js Application

Firstly, create a project directory and `cd` into it like so:

<TerminalInput>mkdir my-nextjs-buttercms-project && cd my-nextjs-buttercms-project</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating and entering into the project directory.</Caption>

Next, initialize your project, creating a `package.json` file in the process:

<TerminalInput>yarn init -y</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initializing your project with a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.</Caption>

<Note>
  Using the <InlineCode>-y</InlineCode> flag will initialize the created{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/creating-a-package#toc-creating-your-first-package">
    these
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  default settings.
</Note>

Next, add the project dependencies:

<TerminalInput>yarn add next react react-dom</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Adding <InlineCode>next</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>react</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>react-dom</InlineCode> as dependencies to your project.</Caption>

With the project initialized, create a `/pages` directory with a `index.js` file inside that uses the following code:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import Head from 'next/head'
import Post from '../components/post'

function HomePage() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([])
  useEffect(() => {
    async function getPosts() {
      const res = await fetch(
        `https://api.buttercms.com/v2/content/?keys=posts&auth_token=${
          process.env.API_TOKEN
        }`
      )
      const { data } = await res.json()
      const allPosts = data.posts
      setPosts([...allPosts])
    }
    getPosts()
  }, [])
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Next.js + ButterCMS</title>
        <link
          rel="stylesheet"
          href="https://css.zeit.sh/v1.css"
          type="text/css"
        />
      </Head>
      {posts.length > 0
        ? posts.map(p => (
            <Post
              alt={p.alt}
              date={p.date}
              key={p.title}
              image={p.image}
              title={p.title}
              url={p.url}
            />
          ))
        : null}
    </>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

  project.
</Caption>

Let's take look at what this file achieves.

Inside the `useEffect` hook, an asynchronous function, `getPosts`, is defined, this is then called in the `useEffect` hook to retrieve the posts on initial load.

With the posts retrieved, they are then mapped over to be displayed with a `<Post>` component that you will create next.

Create a `/components` directory that contains a `post.js` file with the following content:

```jsx
function Post({ alt, date, image, title, url }) {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <a href={url}>
        <img alt={alt} src={image} />
      </a>
      <div className="text">
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        <h4>{date}</h4>
      </div>
      <style jsx>{`
        .container {
          cursor: pointer;
          height: 453px;
          margin-bottom: 48px;
        }
        a {
          border-bottom: none;
        }
        a:hover {
          border-bottom: none;
        }
        .text {
          margin-top: -160px;
          padding: 24px;
          position: absolute;
        }
        h2 {
          color: white;
          font-size: 24px;
          margin-bottom: 0;
        }
        h4 {
          color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
          font-size: 16px;
          font-weight: 500;
          margin-top: 8px;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Post
```

Now that your page and component files have been created, the next step will show you how to use the [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/) to allow for both [local development](/docs/v2/development/basics/) and [cloud deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/).

## Step 3: Adding a `now.json` File

With your project ready, the `now.json` file provides an opportunity to instruct [Now](/docs/v2) on how to [build](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/) and [deploy](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) your project. Add a `now.json` file at the root of your project directory with the following code:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/next" }],
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "API_TOKEN": "@api_token"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file for your Next.js + ButterCMS
  project.
</Caption>

The above [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/) achieves three things:

- [`version`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#version) ensures you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version
- [`builds`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#builds) instructs Now to use the [`@now/next`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/next-js-now-next/) [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) to build your project
- [`build`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#build.env) passes [environment variables](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets/) to the [Build](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/) process for use inside your app

With your `now.json` file created, you should add a `next.config.js` file at the root of your project directory with the code below:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless',
  env: {
    API_TOKEN: process.env.API_TOKEN
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>next.config.js</InlineCode> file for your Next.js +
  ButterCMS project.
</Caption>

The `next.config.js` file achieves two things:

- Instructs Next.js to build for a serverless environment
- Provides access to [environment variables](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets/) inside your Next.js app

Next, you will make your API key available to your application during [local development](/docs/v2/development/basics/) by creating a `.env.build` file.

Create a `.env.build` file at the root of your project directory with the following code, adding your API key obtained in [step 1](#step-1:-create-your-buttercms-content) where instructed:

```bash
API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>.env.build</InlineCode> file for your Next.js +
  ButterCMS project.
</Caption>

Lastly, to make your API key available for [cloud deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/), create a [Now Secret](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets#securing-environment-variables-using-secrets) with the command below:

<TerminalInput>now secrets add API_TOKEN your-space-id</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Adding the <InlineCode>API_TOKEN</InlineCode> secret to your project using <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets#securing-environment-variables-using-secrets">Now Secrets</GenericLink>.
</Caption>

With those steps out the way you are now able to run your application. You can [develop your application locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/) using the following command:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Using the <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> command to simulate the Now deployment environment locally.
</Caption>

By using `now dev`, you are able to run your application locally, in a reproduction of the Now deployment environment. This ensures there are **no surprises when you deploy your app**.

## Step 4: Deploying the Application

With your application ready, it is time to deploy it using **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Using the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command to deploy your project to Now.
</Caption>

You will see a short build step in your terminal followed by the news that your project has been [deployed](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/basics/), it should look similar to the [example app](https://nextjs-buttercms.now-examples.now.sh/).
