When it comes to creating a successful website or app, you will need to add analytics in order to track and understand visitor behaviour and improve based on the data you receive.

This guide will take you through creating an app with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), adding analytics with [Fathom](https://usefathom.com), a simple, lightweight, fast, and privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics.

## Step 1: Creating Your App

Next.js is a framework, created by Vercel, for creating production-ready and lightning-fast React apps with a lot of handy features built-in.

To create your new Next.js application, run the following [npm](http://npmjs.com/) command, with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/blog/create-next-app), from your terminal and follow the installation steps:

<Snippet dark text="npm init next-app my-next-app && cd my-next-app" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js project with create-next-app and npm, then moving into the project directory.</Caption>

To run your new app locally, run the following command in your terminal, from your new project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npm run dev" />
<Caption>Starting a local Next.js development server.</Caption>

For more information on how to build your Next.js app and what you can do with it, see the [Next.js website](https://nextjs.org) and [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Step 2: Adding Fathom

To add Fathom Analytics to your new Next.js app, firstly [create an account with Fathom](https://app.usefathom.com/register). You will be asked to add a site when logged in. If you plan on using a [Custom Domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains), enter that as your site URL. Alternatively, if you want to use a free production URL from Vercel, you can go to the Deploy step to deploy your application and get a URL to add before this step.

Click "Get site code" to then get the code for your app's analytics.

Next, add the `fathom-client` package to your project using npm:

<Snippet dark text="npm install fathom-client" />

Create an `_app.js` file within the `/pages` directory of your app and add the following code as its contents. Use the site code you received previously and replace `YOUR_FATHOM_TRACKING_CODE` with it, then replace `YOUR_SITE_URL` with the Site URL that you chose.

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import * as Fathom from 'fathom-client'

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize Fathom when the app loads
    Fathom.load('YOUR_FATHOM_TRACKING_CODE', {
      includedDomains: ['YOUR_SITE_URL']
    })

    function onRouteChangeComplete() {
      Fathom.trackPageview()
    }
    // Record a pageview when route changes
    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', onRouteChangeComplete)

    // Unassign event listener
    return () => {
      router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', onRouteChangeComplete)
    }
  }, [])

  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default App
```

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
