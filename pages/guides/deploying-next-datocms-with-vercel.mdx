For the frontend of this project, you will be using Next.js – the production-ready React framework. For the backend you will be using [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/) – a powerful headless CMS that allows you to **rapidly create, manage, and distribute content**.

Two of the biggest selling points for DatoCMS are:

- **GraphQL API** for powerful developer tools and complete control over the data your website downloads;
- **Out-of-the-box support to responsive, progressive, lazy-loaded images** thanks to the fact that its GraphQL API already exposes [pre-computed low-quality image placeholders](https://www.datocms.com/blog/offer-responsive-progressive-lqip-images-in-2020) (LQIP, or blur-up placeholders), allowing webpages to get everything they need in a single request, avoiding content reflows.

Follow this guide to create a starting point for you to get your own blog up and running.

## Step 1: Create your content

First, [create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com). After creating an account, create a **new project** from the dashboard. You can select a **Blank Project**. Once created, enter the project.

### Create an `Author` model

Click the **Settings** tab, and choose the **Models** option. Click on the plus icon, and create a new **Model** called **Author**.

Next, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings):

- **Name**: field of type **Single-line string** (under the _Text_ group)
- **Picture**: field of type **Single asset** (under the _Media_ group)

    process.env.ASSETS

  width={1440 / 1.5}
  height={900 / 1.5}
  oversize
  video
/>
<Caption>Follow these steps to create the Author model.</Caption>

### Create a `Post` model

Repeat the process to create a new model: this time call it **Post**.

<Note>
  From the "Additional Settings" tab, turn on{' '}
  <strong>Enable draft/published system.</strong> This setting lets you preview
  the content.
</Note>

Next, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings unless specified):

- **Title**: field of type **Single-line string** (under the _Text_ group)
- **Content**: field of type **Multiple-paragraph text** (under the _Text_ group)
- **Excerpt**: field of type **Single-line string** (under the _Text_ group)
- **Cover image**: field of type **Single asset** (under the _Media_ group)
- **Date**: field of type **Date** (under the _Date and time_ group)
- **Author**: field of type **Single link** (under the _Links_ group). From the "Validations" tab under "Accept only specified model", select **Author**
- **Slug**: field of type **Slug** (under the _SEO_ group). From the "Validations" tab under "Reference field" select **Title**

### Create a `Blog` model

The last model needed is called **Blog**. Make sure to check the "Single instance?" option for this, as you only want to create a **single record of this type** that will hold the SEO information for the blog page.

Next, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings unless specified):

- **SEO**: field of type **SEO meta tags** (under the _SEO_ group)

### Populate content

From the **Content** menu at the top, select **Author** and then create a new record. In this case, you can use dummy data for the text and download an image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

    process.env.ASSETS

  width={1440 / 1.5}
  height={900 / 1.5}

/>
<Caption>Follow these steps to populate your content.</Caption>

Then create a couple of **Post** records. You can write markdown for the **Content** field, and for the Author you can pick one of the authors you created earlier.

<Note>
  For each post record, you need to click <strong>Publish</strong> after saving.
  If not, the post will be in the draft state.
</Note>

The last step is to fill in some SEO meta tags for your blog. Go to the **Blog** section, insert a title and a description and click "Save".

That's it for creating content! In general, you can edit both **Content** and **Models** at any time, giving you complete flexibility over your content.

Next, create a set of API tokens to be used in your app, these will allow the [DatoCMS Client](https://www.datocms.com/developers/docs/javascript/tutorials/using-js-cda-sdk/) to request your posts from the DatoCMS API.

## Step 2: Create a read-only API key

Click the **Settings** tab, and choose the **API tokens** option, then click on the plus icon to create a new **API token**.

<Note>
  Make sure you only give the permissions to access the (read-only) Content
  Delivery API!
</Note>

    process.env.ASSETS

/>
<Caption>Follow these steps to create a read-only API Token for DatoCMS GraphQL API.</Caption>

Make a note of the newly created access token, as it will be used later on.

That's all the setup required for [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/)! Within only **a few minutes** you have managed to create a **Content Model**, add content, and generate an API token.

## Step 3: Create Your Next.js App

To display your new blog and content, create a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application using [create-next-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), then run the following command and follow the wizard:

<Snippet dark text="npm init next-app my-datocms-project" />
<Caption>Bootstrap a Next.js application from your command line.</Caption>

Enter inside the project directory, install the [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) and [react-datocms](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms) package, and start the development server:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="cd my-datocms-project && yarn add graphql-request react-datocms && yarn dev"
/>
<Caption>Moving to your project, installing dependencies, and starting a local development server from the command line.</Caption>

You'll need to setup a GraphQL client pointing to the API of your DatoCMS project. Create a new `lib` directory for that, and inside of it create a file called `datocms.js`:

```jsx
import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request'

export function request({ query, variables, preview }) {
  const endpoint = preview
    ? `https://graphql.datocms.com/preview`
    : `https://graphql.datocms.com/`

  const client = new GraphQLClient(endpoint, {
    headers: {
      authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NEXT_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN}`
    }
  })
  return client.request(query, variables)
}
```

<Caption>
  Creating a function in <InlineCode>lib/datocms.js</InlineCode> to get data
  from DatoCMS.
</Caption>

Using an environment variable starting with `NEXT_` means that it will be automatically read by Next.js. Then, you can set the environment variable inside a `.env` file:

<Snippet dark text="echo 'NEXT_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN=YOUR-API-TOKEN' >> .env" />
<Caption>Creating an environment variable in a <InlineCode>.env</InlineCode> file for your API token.</Caption>

Make sure that Git will ignore it by adding it to `.gitignore`:

<Snippet dark text="echo '.env' >> .gitignore" />
<Caption>Adding <InlineCode>.env</InlineCode> to the <InlineCode>.gitignore</InlineCode> file to avoid publishing to Git.</Caption>

Next, go to `pages/index.js` — that is, the component that renders the homepage of the project — and replace its contents the following code:

```jsx
import { request } from '../lib/datocms'
import { Image, renderMetaTags } from 'react-datocms'
import Head from 'next/head'

const HOMEPAGE_QUERY = `
query HomePage($limit: IntType) {
  site: _site {
    favicon: faviconMetaTags {
      attributes
      content
      tag
    }
  }
  blog {
    seo: _seoMetaTags {
      attributes
      content
      tag
    }
  }
  allPosts(first: $limit) {
    id
    title
    excerpt
    date
    author {
      name
    }
    coverImage {
      responsiveImage(imgixParams: { fit: crop, w: 300, h: 300, auto: format }) {
        srcSet
        webpSrcSet
        sizes
        src
        width
        height
        aspectRatio
        alt
        title
        base64
      }
    }
  }
}`

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await request({
    query: HOMEPAGE_QUERY,
    variables: { limit: 10 }
  })

  return {
    props: {
      data
    }
  }
}

export default function Home({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>{renderMetaTags(data.blog.seo.concat(data.site.favicon))}</Head>
      {data.allPosts.map(blogPost => (
        <article key={blogPost.id}>
          <Image data={blogPost.coverImage.responsiveImage} />
          <h6>{blogPost.title}</h6>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### What the `index.js` Achieves

This `index.js` example requires the GraphQL client you created previously. Then, inside the [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) function, a GraphQL request is performed, so that Next.js will **pre-render this page at build time** using the props returned by it.

The `responsiveImage` part of the GraphQL query returns image attributes that will help you set up [responsive images in your frontend](/docs/content-delivery-api/images-and-videos#responsive-images) without any additional manipulation. The page component passes this data to the `<Image/>` component of the [react-datocms](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms) package to render a **lazy-loaded image with a low-quality image placeholder**.

Similarly to what DatoCMS offers with responsive images, both the `faviconMetaTags` and `_seoMetaTags` parts of the query return [pre-computed meta tags](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/seo-and-favicon) based on the content you insert inside DatoCMS. You can easily append such meta tags to the `head` of your page using Next.js's `<Head/>` component and the `renderMetaTags` helper, which is also part of the [react-datocms](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms) package.

<Note>
  The precise query to use depends on the models available in your specific
  DatoCMS project! You can learn everything you need regarding how to build
  GraphQL queries on DatoCMS's{' '}

  documentation.
</Note>

## Setup Next.js Preview Mode

When using `getStaticProps`, the props will be generated at build time, which is great from a performance point of view, but not ideal when you’re [writing a draft on DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/docs/general-concepts/draft-published). In this case, you want to preview the draft immediately on your page.

For solving that problem, Next.js has the feature called [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode).

### Create a preview API route

This API route file can have any name - e.g. `pages/api/preview.js`, thought it must be within the `pages/api` directory. In this API route, you will call `setPreviewData` on the response object. The argument for `setPreviewData` should be an object, and this can be used by `getStaticProps` ([more on this later](#update-getstaticprops)).

```jsx
export default (req, res) => {
  res.setPreviewData({})
  res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/' })
  res.end()
}
```

<Caption>The contents of a preview API route in Next.js.</Caption>

To test this, manually access the route from your browser by heading to `http://localhost:3000/api/preview`. You’ll notice that you'll be redirected to the homepage with two cookies set: `__prerender_bypass` and `__next_preview_data`.

### Update getStaticProps

The next step is to update `getStaticProps` to support the preview mode. If you request a page which has `getStaticProps` with the preview mode cookies set via `res.setPreviewData`, then `getStaticProps` **will be called at request time instead of at build time**.

Furthermore, it will be called with a context object where:

- `context.preview` will be true.
- `context.previewData` will be the same as the argument used for `res.setPreviewData`.

In this case, use the `https://graphql.datocms.com/preview` endpoint to **access records at their latest version available**, instead of only the currently published.

Both endpoints offer exactly the same queries, the only thing that will change will be the returned content:

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const data = await request({
    query: HOMEPAGE_QUERY,
    variables: { limit: 10 },
    preview: context.preview
  })

  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
```

  .
</Note>

## Step 4: Deploy

Before deploying, make the DatoCMS API token available for your deployment, first add a `vercel.json` file at the root of your project directory with the following contents:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NEXT_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN": "@datocms_api_token"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  DatoCMS project.
</Caption>

Next, create a [Secret](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets#securing-environment-variables-using-secrets) using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) with the command below:

<Snippet dark text="vercel secrets add datocms_api_token YOUR-API-TOKEN" />
