[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a very popular framework for creating static websites. It's fast and flexible.

In this guide, we will walk you through setting up a Hugo website and deploying it with [ZEIT Now](/now).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Hugo Project

To [get a Hugo project running](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), you need to install a precompiled binary on your machine. Hugo currently provides [pre-built binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Therefore, you can either download the appropriate version for your machine from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) or install it via your machine's package manager.

For macOS users, you can install Hugo via [Brew](https://brew.sh):

<Snippet dark text="brew install hugo" />

For Windows users, you can install Hugo via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

<Snippet dark text="choco install hugo -confirm" />
<Caption>Installing <Link href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Hugo CLI</Link> via <Link href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</Link>.</Caption>

Next, run the following command to create a Hugo project via the CLI:

<Snippet dark text="hugo new site my-hugo-project" />
<Caption>Creating a new Hugo project via the CLI.</Caption>

You can add a theme to beautify the newly created site. `cd` into the `my-hugo-project` directory and run the following command to add a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/):

<Snippet dark text="git init && git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke" />
<Caption>Download a new theme to the Hugo project.</Caption>

The next step is to activate the theme. From your terminal, add the [ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme to the `config.toml` file.

<Snippet dark text={`echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml`} />
<Caption>Edit your config.toml configuration file, and add the theme</Caption>

### Create Some Content

You can add some content to the Hugo project by running the following command:

<Snippet dark text="hugo new posts/my-first-post.md" />
<Caption>Creating a new post in the Hugo project via the CLI.</Caption>

Once you are done running the command, edit the `my-first-post.md` file (within the `contents/posts` directories) and add the following content below the generated metadata:

```markdown
## Deploying Hugo with ZEIT Now
```

You can now see your project running locally with the following command:

<Snippet dark text="hugo server -D" />
<Caption>Running the server locally with drafts enabled</Caption>

<Note>
  Before deploying, ensure the <InlineCode>draft</InlineCode> value in your{' '}
  <InlineCode>my-first-post.md</InlineCode> file is set to{' '}
  <InlineCode>false</InlineCode>. If it remains as <InlineCode>true</InlineCode>
  , the content of your posts won't show up in production.
</Note>

## Step 2: Deploying Your Hugo Website with ZEIT Now

With your Hugo application set up, it is ready to deploy with [Now](/docs/v2).

First, create a `package.json` in the project directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "hugo"
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  build scripts.

With the build scripts added, you can now deploy your Hugo project.

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

With Now installed, you can deploy from your terminal with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Hugo project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
