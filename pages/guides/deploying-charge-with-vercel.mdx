[Charge](https://charge.js.org/) is an opinionated, zero-config static site generator written in JavaScript. Charge is fast, simple and behaves the way you expect it to.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating and [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) a basic Charge website with [<ProductName />](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Charge Project

[Charge](https://charge.js.org/) focuses on simplicity and provides no boilerplate as a result. To get started with Charge create your project directory, let's call it `charge-app`, and `cd` into it:

<Snippet dark text="mkdir charge-app && cd charge-app" />
<Caption>
  Creating and entering into the <InlineCode>/charge-app</InlineCode>{' '}directory.
</Caption>

Next, [initialize](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) the project:

<Snippet dark text="npm init" />
<Caption>
  Initializing the project, this creates a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode>{' '}file.
</Caption>

<Note>
  During the initializing process, npm will ask questions about your project.
  Answer these how you wish; there are no prerequisites for this example.
</Note>

When this is complete, add Charge as a [development dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file):

<Snippet dark text="npm i -D @static/charge" />
<Caption>
  Adding Charge as a development dependency to our project.
</Caption>

Now, make an addition to `package.json`, as recommended by the [Charge documentation](https://charge.js.org/usage), by adding the following `scripts` object:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "charge serve src",
    "build": "charge build src public"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding development and build scripts to the{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

These scripts enable you to run a local development environment and build your Charge site when [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) with `now`.

## Step 2: Add Content To Your Charge Project

The following example content setup demonstrates a few of Charge's key features, notably the use of `.jsx`, `.mdx`, and using a layout component.

Firstly, create two directories, `/src` and `/src/pages` within your project directory:

<Snippet dark text="mkdir src && mkdir src/pages" />
<Caption>
  Creating a <InlineCode>/src</InlineCode>{' '}directory with a <InlineCode>/pages</InlineCode>{' '} directory inside of it.
</Caption>

By keeping your components inside of the `/src` directory and our content inside of the `/pages` directory, this will help keep your project organized.

Next, create an `index.html.jsx` file inside the `/src` directory that will serve as the entrypoint to your Charge-powered website.

<Note>
  During the build process, Charge will remove <InlineCode>jsx</InlineCode> and
  <InlineCode>mdx</InlineCode>
  extensions, leaving you with just static <InlineCode>html</InlineCode>files.
</Note>

Now, you will need to add some some content to your index file. Use the example below, or add your own:

```jsx
export default () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to my new Charge site!</h1>
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Like many static site generators, Charge encourages the use of a layout component. This component will be used to define the layout of your `.mdx` pages later on.

<Note>
  Charge automatically imports React into <InlineCode>jsx</InlineCode> files so
  you don't have to.
</Note>

Create a simple `layout.html.jsx` file inside of the `/src` directory with the following content:

```jsx
export default ({ children }) => {
  return children
}
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

If, at any point, you want to see how your changes look, you can serve them locally with the script you added in the first step:

<Snippet dark text="npm run dev" />
<Caption>
  Starting up a local development server using a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> script.
</Caption>

Charge will open a new tab for you, if not you can navigate to `localhost:2468` to see the changes you make.

Now that you have a layout component, use it to wrap a `.mdx` file. Create a file named `about.html.mdx` inside of your `/pages` directory.

Add some content to your about page and export it inside of the layout component you created above. Your `about.html.mdx` should look similar to this:

```jsx
import Layout from '../layout.html.jsx'

Everything between the import and export in the source is **just markdown** using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

Before deploying your project, import the about page you just created by modifying your `index.html.jsx` to look like this:

```jsx
import About from './pages/about.html.mdx'

export default () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my new Charge site!</h1>
      <About />
    </>
  )
}
```

<Caption>

  that imports the About content component and uses it in the page.
</Caption>

Now that you have a simple Charge site created, you're ready to deploy with [<ProductName />](/docs/v2).

## Step 3: Deploy Your Charge Project with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
