[Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io) is a platform for structured content with an open source editing environment. Sanity Studio is a single page application written in React, where you can configure the document types and input fields, with simple JavaScript objects. The Studio connects to Sanity’s hosted real-time APIs. You can also customize the Studio with your own input components, plugins, and tools.

This guide will walk you through how to deploy Sanity Studio with Now in three simple steps. It will also cover how to deploy the Studio in a [monorepo](/examples/monorepo/).

## Step 1: Setting Up your Sanity Studio Project

<Note>You can skip this step if you already have a project set up.</Note>

First, install the [Sanity CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/cli):

<TerminalInput>yarn global add @sanity/cli</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Adding the Sanity CLI as a global package to enable use of the <InlineCode>sanity</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

To initiate a new project and download the Studio code to your computer, run the following in the command line:

<TerminalInput>sanity init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initiating a new Sanity project.</Caption>

The Sanity CLI will walk you through the necessary steps to set up a project, letting you choose a schema template. When you're done with these steps, the CLI will download the source code and configuration to get you started. To start a local development server, `cd` into the project folder and run the following command:

<TerminalInput>sanity start</TerminalInput>

Check out [Sanity’s documentation](https://sanity.io/docs) to learn more about how to configure and customize the Studio.

## Step 2: Preparing for Deployment

Now provides an environment to deploy all types of projects, including static files, making it a good option for deploying your Sanity project with **just a single command**.

Add the following scripts to the Studio’s `package.json` file:

```json
{
...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "sanity start",
    "test": "sanity check",
    "build": "sanity build"
  }
}.
```

  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

Lastly, add `@sanity/cli` as a [development dependency](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/dependency-types#toc-dev-dependencies), this will allow [Now](/now) to build your project on deployment.

<TerminalInput>yarn add -D @sanity/cli</TerminalInput>

After saving your `package.json` file you will be ready to deploy your project.

## Step 3: Deploy With Now

You can choose whether you want to deploy the Studio directly from the command line, or from a Git repository by installing either the [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github) or [Now for GitLab](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab) integrations.

To deploy your project from the command line, all it takes is **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

Once Sanity Studio is deployed, you will need to add it's URL to Sanity’s [CORS origins](https://www.sanity.io/docs/front-ends/cors) settings. You can do this from the command line:

<TerminalInput>sanity cors add https://your-url.now.sh --credentials</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Adding CORS credentials to your Sanity project.</Caption>

Alternatively, you can navigate to [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io), find your project and under Settings > API, add the Studio URL to the CORS origins list. You should allow credentials as the Studio requires authentication for added security whereas most frontends do not.
