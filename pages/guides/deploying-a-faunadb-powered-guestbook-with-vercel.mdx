With the release of [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/blog/create-next-app), bootstrapping [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps is now a guided process that allows you to get up and running in seconds by using ready-made examples.

This guide walks you through creating a Next.js guestbook app that receives data from a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API powered by [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/), and how to deploy it with <ProductName />.

## Step 1: Creating a FaunaDB Database

From the [FaunaDB dashboard](https://dashboard.fauna.com/), create a [new database](https://dashboard.fauna.com/db-new/), providing a name of your choosing.

Once created, select the Security tab and create a new key with the following details:

- Database: `example`
- Role: `Admin`
- Key Name: `secret-key`

Make a note of the secret when it is shown as you will need this for Step 2.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Next.js App

Set up your bootstrapped Next.js app with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and move into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npx create-next-app --example with-graphql-faunadb my-nextjs-guestbook && cd my-nextjs-guestbook" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js, GraphQL, and FaunaDB app with <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx</Link> and moving into the project directory.</Caption>

By including the `with-graphql-faunadb` argument, `create-next-app` bootstraps an app based off of a template found in the [Next.js examples repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).

Install the project dependencies:

<Snippet dark text="npm i" />
<Caption>Installing the dependencies for your project with <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</Link>.</Caption>

Then, start the setup script, providing your FaunaDB secret obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-creating-a-faunadb-database) when prompted:

<Snippet dark text="npm run setup" />
<Caption>Running the setup script provided for your project.</Caption>

This script achieves the following:

- Uploads the GraphQL schema
- Creates a role that can only access your guestbook entries
- Creates a key on that role
- Returns a key for you to paste in the `next.config.js`

Next, add the key returned by the setup script to your `next.config.js` file by replacing the value for the `faunaDbSecret` property with the key created by the script.

## Step 3: Deploying Your App with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

## Bonus: Exploring the App

The app features a working Guestbook SPA with GraphQL support, connected to an example FaunaDB database.

    FaunaDB documentation
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

By importing a GraphQL schema into your database, you gain access to FaunaDBâ€™s versatile GraphQL endpoint. This endpoint automatically resolves GraphQL queries and mutations.

The GraphQL import process generates the requisite **Collections**, **Indexes**, and **resolvers** expected of your schema. FaunaDB also generates CRUD mutations for each GraphQL object.

All of the components for the app are found in the `/components` directory. Meanwhile, the CSS is in JavaScript and located in the `/styles` directory, this is automatically vendor-prefixed when necessary.

In `graphql/api.js`, you will find two GraphQL requests that correspond to a query and a single mutation. These methods fetch guestbook entries and create new ones, respectively.
