With the release of [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/blog/create-next-app), bootstrapping [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps is now a guided process that allows you to get up and running in seconds by using ready-made examples.

This guide walks you through creating a Next.js guestbook app that receives data from a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API powered by [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/), and how to deploy it with ZEIT Now.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Next.js App

Set up your bootstrapped Next.js app with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and move into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npx create-next-app --example with-graphql-faunadb my-nextjs-guestbook && cd my-nextjs-guestbook" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js, GraphQL, and FaunaDB app with <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx</Link> and moving into the project directory.</Caption>

By including the `with-graphql-faunadb` argument, `create-next-app` bootstraps an app based off of a template found in the [Next.js examples repository](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples).

## Step 2: Deploying Your Next.js App with ZEIT Now

With your Next.js app set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

Using [Now CLI](/download), deploy your website with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Next.js app when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/more/now-for-github), [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/more/now-for-gitlab), or [Now for Bitbucket](/docs/v2/more/now-for-bitbucket) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.

## Bonus: Exploring the App

The app features a working Guestbook SPA with GraphQL support, connected to an example FaunaDB database.

  FaunaDB provides support for importing GraphQL schemas, you can read more
  about this in the{' '}
  <Link href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/start/graphql#import">
    FaunaDB documentation
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

By importing a GraphQL schema into your database, you gain access to FaunaDB’s versatile GraphQL endpoint. This endpoint automatically resolves GraphQL queries and mutations.

The GraphQL import process generates the requisite **Collections**, **Indexes**, and **resolvers** expected of your schema. FaunaDB also generates CRUD mutations for each GraphQL object.

All of the components for the app are found in the `/components` directory. Meanwhile, the CSS is in JavaScript and located in the `/styles` directory, this is automatically vendor-prefixed when necessary.

In `graphql/api.js`, you will find two GraphQL requests that correspond to a query and a single mutation. These methods fetch guestbook entries and create new ones, respectively.
