[Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io) is a platform for structured content with an open source editing environment. Sanity Studio is a single page app written in React, where you can configure the document types and input fields, with simple JavaScript objects. The Studio connects to Sanity’s hosted real-time APIs. You can also customize the Studio with your own input components, plugins, and tools.

This guide will walk you through how to deploy Sanity Studio with <ProductName /> in three simple steps.

## Step 1: Setting Up your Sanity Studio Project

<Note>You can skip this step if you already have a project set up.</Note>

First, install the [Sanity CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/cli):

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g @sanity/cli" />
<Caption>Adding the Sanity CLI as a global package to enable use of the <InlineCode>sanity</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

To initiate a new project and download the Studio code to your computer, run the following in the command line:

<Snippet dark text="sanity init" />
<Caption>Initiating a new Sanity project.</Caption>

The Sanity CLI will walk you through the necessary steps to set up a project, letting you choose a schema template. When you're done with these steps, the CLI will download the source code and configuration to get you started. To start a local development server, `cd` into the project folder and run the following command:

<Snippet dark text="sanity start" />
<Caption>Starting a local development server for Sanity Studio.</Caption>

Check out [Sanity’s documentation](https://sanity.io/docs) to learn more about how to configure and customize the Studio.

## Step 2: Preparing for Deployment

To provide <ProductName /> with routing information for the app, add a `now.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/.*", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

  project.
</Caption>

​<ProductName /> provides an environment to deploy all types of projects, including static files, making it a good option for deploying your Sanity project with **a single command**.

Add the following scripts to the Studio’s `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "sanity start",
    "test": "sanity check",
    "build": "sanity build public -y"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding build scripts to your Sanity project's{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

<Note>
  The <InlineCode>-y</InlineCode> argument in the <InlineCode>build</InlineCode>{' '}
  accepts the defaults for Sanity's build, otherwise the deployment will hang
  when Sanity's CLI asks questions.
</Note>

Lastly, add `@sanity/cli` as a [development dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file), this will allow [<ProductName />](/) to build your project on deployment.

<Snippet dark text="npm i -D @sanity/cli" />
<Caption>
  Adding the Sanity CLI to the project as a development dependency.
</Caption>

After saving your `package.json` file you will be ready to deploy your project.

## Step 3: Deploy With <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

Once Sanity Studio is deployed, you will need to add it's URL to Sanity’s [CORS origins](https://www.sanity.io/docs/front-ends/cors) settings. You can do this from the command line:

<Snippet dark text="sanity cors add https://your-url.now.sh --credentials" />
<Caption>Adding CORS credentials to your Sanity project.</Caption>

Alternatively, you can navigate to [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io), find your project and under Settings > API, add the Studio URL to the CORS origins list. You should allow credentials as the Studio requires authentication for added security whereas most frontends do not.
