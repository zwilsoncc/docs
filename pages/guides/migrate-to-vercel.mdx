## Frontend Frameworks

​<ProductName /> tries to automatically detect the frontend framework you’re using for your project and configure the project settings for you. If you’d like to override the settings or specify a different framework, take a look at [our documentation on build settings](/docs/v2/build-step).

## Custom Domains

To migrate your domains to <ProductName />, refer to the following documentation:

- [Custom Domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains)
- [Zero-Downtime Domain Migration with <ProductName />](/guides/zero-downtime-domain-migration)

## Serverful vs. Serverless APIs

Serverful apps need to run consistently, watching for requests. Then, when requested, the app handles the request itself.

In serverful monolith style apps, routing is commonly handled by a single file. Let's look at an Express.js example to illustrate this:

```js
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('GET homepage.')
})

app.post('/teams', function(req, res) {
  res.send('POST teams data.')
})

app.get('/teams/data', function(req, res) {
  res.send('GET teams data.')
})
```

<Caption>A common routes configuration for serverful Express.js.</Caption>

### Moving to <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} /> and Serverless

With serverless, functionality is split into separate files, called [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction). Instead of a file or process growing monolithically, this gives us the ability to break down the app into independently scalable parts.

When a path is requested, the Serverless Function for that path is [invoked](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/). This avoids the whole app from having to wait and watch for requests, saving on time and resources.

#### Step 1: Creating an API Directory

The only requirement for Serverless Functions on <ProductName />, without advanced configuration, is that you place your files inside of an `/api` directory. By doing this, <ProductName /> will be able to handle both the routing and building of these files – dramatically simplifying the process of developing an API.

When using the `/api` directory, routing is based on the filesystem, making it easy to keep track of endpoints simply by looking at the file tree. For example, the file `/api/teams/example.js` would be available at the endpoint `/api/teams/example`.

<Note>
  When making calls to the <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory, no file
  extensions are required.
</Note>

For the above example, you would only need to place the `/teams` directory within the `/api` directory.

#### Step 2: Creating Files for Routes

With the `/api` directory created and the structure added, the next step is to add the required files for the endpoints.

As an example the first file – `index.js` – would sit at the root of the `/api` directory. This is equivalent to `app.get('/'`, and the contents of the file would be:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world from the /api route!')
}
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

The next file would be placed inside the `/teams` directory inside of the `/api` directory, also named `index.js`. This is equivalent to `app.post('/teams')` and could be used to create a new team. The contents of the file would be:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { name } = req.body
  res.send(
    `This response would create a new team called ${name}, using a POST request.`
  )
}
```

<Caption>

  within the <InlineCode>/api/teams</InlineCode> directories.
</Caption>

The last route would also be placed in the `/teams` directory, however, it would be named `data.js` - this is equivalent to `app.get('/teams/data')`. The contents of the file would be:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.send('This response would send information about teams.')
}
```

<Caption>
  A Serverless Function in an example <InlineCode>data.js</InlineCode> file,
  within the <InlineCode>/api/teams</InlineCode> directories.
</Caption>

<Note>
  The endpoint for an <InlineCode>index.js</InlineCode> file can be invoked
  through the parent folder's path. You can opt-out of this behavior by not
  using the <InlineCode>index.js</InlineCode> filename for API endpoints.
</Note>

#### Bonus: Dynamic Routes

Using route parameters with your Serverless Functions is made easy with <ProductName />. Let's first take a look at another serverful Express.js example that uses a dynamic route.

```js
app.get('/teams/:member', function(req, res) {
  res.send(`GET details about the ${req.query.member}.`)
})
```

<Caption>
  A common routes configuration, that receives and uses a route parameter, for
  serverful Express.js.
</Caption>

The above route uses the route parameter _member_, with Express.js making it available as part of the `req.query` object.

To convert this route for use inside of the `/api` directory with <ProductName />, we will once again place it inside the `/teams` directory. However, this time we will name it `[member].js` - this is called a _Path Segment_.

Path Segments allow your endpoints to receive route parameters and, just like Express, they are made available on the `req.query` object with the key specified in the filename.

Taking this into account, we can convert the above Express route for <ProductName /> with the following code:

```js
// api/teams/[member].js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.send(`This response will send details about the ${req.query.member}.`)
}
```
