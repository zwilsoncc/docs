[MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) is an award-winning React and MDX-based presentation framework.

## Step 1: Set Up Your MDX Deck Project

Set up an MDX Deck project with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) and move into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npm init deck my-presentation && cd my-presentation" />

## Step 2: Deploying Your MDX Deck Project with ZEIT Now

With an MDX Deck project set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

Using [Now CLI](/download), deploy your website with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your MDX Deck project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
