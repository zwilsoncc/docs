In this guide, we will be deploying an Apollo GraphQL server with ZEIT Now.

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a directory for the project and `cd` into it via your terminal. It can be done with the following command:

<Snippet dark text="mkdir -p apolloserver/api && cd apolloserver" />
<Caption>
  Creating and entering into the <InlineCode>/apolloserver</InlineCode> directory which also contains an <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

Next, install the `apollo-server-micro` and `graphql` packages via your terminal.

<Snippet dark text="npm i apollo-server-micro graphql" />
<Caption>
  Adding <InlineCode>apollo-server-micro</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>graphql</InlineCode> as dependencies to the project.
</Caption>

Once the dependencies are installed, go ahead and create an `index.js` file inside of the `/api` directory with the following code as its contents:

```js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-micro')

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (root, args, context) => {
      return 'Hello world!'
    }
  }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
  playground: true
})

module.exports = server.createHandler({ path: '/api' })
```

## Deploy with Now

With your project setup you are ready to deploy it with [Now](/now).

Deploying your project could not be easier and can be done with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

<Caption>
  Deploying the app with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.
</Caption>

Your project has now been deployed, you can access the Apollo Server endpoint, using the deployment URL generated, at `/api`.

If you want to deploy your ApolloServer project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
