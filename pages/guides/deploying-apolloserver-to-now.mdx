In this guide, we will be deploying an Apollo GraphQL server with ZEIT Now.

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a directory for the project and `cd` into it via your terminal. It can be done with the following command:

<TerminalInput>mkdir apolloserver && cd apolloserver</TerminalInput>

Next, install the `apollo-server-micro` and `graphql` packages via your terminal.

<TerminalInput>yarn add apollo-server-micro graphql</TerminalInput>

Once the dependencies are installed, go ahead and create an `index.js` file at the root of the project directory with the following code as its contents:

```js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-micro')

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (root, args, context) => {
      return "Hello world! It's your boy, how far now unicodeveloper"
    }
  }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
  playground: true
})

module.exports = server.createHandler()
```

## Deploy with Now

With your project setup you are ready to deploy it with [Now](/now).

Deploying your project could not be easier and can be done with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you want to deploy your ApolloServer project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
