VuePress is a vue-powered static generator. It is used for generating static sites with a focus on writing.

This guide will cover how to create and deploy a VuePress application to ZEIT Now.

Already have a VuePress project? [Skip to deploying](#step-3:-deploy-vuepress-with-now)!

## Step 1: Getting Started with VuePress

The first step is to create a project and `cd` into it via your terminal.

<TerminalInput>mkdir vuepress-project && cd vuepress-project</TerminalInput>

Next, install VuePress as a [local dev dependency](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/usage). Use the following command:

<TerminalInput>yarn add --dev vuepress</TerminalInput>

Once the dependencies are installed, create a `README.md` with the following contents:

```markdown
# Hello From Vuepress on Now 2.0!
```

Next, create a `guide` directory within the project and add a `README.md` file with the following code:

```markdown
# Guides

This page lists and describes your project with guides!
```

## Step 2: Configure and Run VuePress

We have created a few documentation files. Now, we are ready to configure VuePress.

With a few documentation pages created, you now need to configure VuePress.

Create a `.vuepress` folder inside the project directory with a `config.js` file and insert the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  title: 'My VuePress Project',
  description: 'A simple VuePress project deployed with ZEIT Now.',
  themeConfig: {
    nav: [{ text: 'Home', link: '/' }, { text: 'Guide', link: '/guides/' }]
  }
}
```

Next, add some development scripts to the `package.json` file in the root project directory.

```js
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vuepress dev",
      "now-dev": "vuepress dev docs --port=$PORT"
    }
}
```

The [`@now/static-build` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#local-development) supports a custom `now-dev` script that allows you to define [custom development behavior](/docs/v2/development/basics/#custom-development-environment) while gaining extra features that mimic the Now platform locally.

Now, you can run VuePress by [replicating the Now environment locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with a single command:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>

## Step 3: Deploy VuePress with Now

First, we need to create a [`now.json` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) to instruct Now on how to build the project.

Add the following code to the `now.json` file:

```js
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "vuepress",
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build", "config": { "distDir": ".vuepress/dist" } }
  ]
}
```

- The `version` property specifies the [Now 2.0](/now) platform version.
- The [`builds` property](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) allows Now to use a [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) with a specific source target. We used the [`@now/static-build`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/) to build and deploy a static project. This module takes a Node.js `package.json` file, installs its listed dependencies, executes a configured `now-build` script, and exposes the resulting `dist` directory as the [build output](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs) for serving.

The [`distDir` option](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#configuring-the-build-output-directory) in the build step instructs Now to identify `.vuepress/dist` as the static folder and build output directory.

Next, we need to add a script in the `package.json` file that specifies the command Now will run to "build" the application in the cloud.

```js
{
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "build": "vuepress build",
        "now-build": "npm run build && mv docs/.vuepress/dist dist"
    }
}
```

  VuePress and a <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script to instruct Now how
  to build the application.
</Caption>

Finally, deploy the app with the [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli).

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

Otherwise, if you want your application to deploy automatically, you can [install the Now for GitHub app](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) and have updates for your GitHub repository deploy and alias on every push.

When your app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL like the following: <https://vuepress-nv3m85eee.now.sh/>
