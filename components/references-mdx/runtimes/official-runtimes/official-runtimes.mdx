# Official Runtimes

Runtimes are modules that transform your source code into [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/), which are served by our [CDN at the edge](/docs/v2/network/caching/).

<Note type="warning">
  In most cases, advanced Runtimes usage with configuration is not necessary.

## Node.js

<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

The Node.js Runtime, by default, builds and serves Serverless Functions within the `/api` directory of a project, providing the files have a file extension of either `.js` or `.ts`.

A Node.js Serverless Function must export a default function handler, for example:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

<Caption>

  <Link href="#node.js-request-and-response-objects">

  </Link>
  .
</Caption>

<Note>
  The Node.js Runtime also supports{' '}
  <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">
    {' '}
    asynchronous functions
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

If you need more advanced behavior, such as a custom build step or private npm modules, see the [Advanced Node.js Usage section](#advanced-usage/advanced-node-js-usage).

### Node.js Version

The default Node.js version used is **10**, but can be changed to **12** by defining an `engines` property in a `package.json` file, like in the example below:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "12.x"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Defining the <InlineCode>engines</InlineCode> property in a{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

When defining an `engines` property, there are various different values that can be supplied. However, all of them have to satisfy one of two [SemVer ranges](https://devhints.io/semver):

- **10.x** (The default if the property is not defined)
- **12.x**

For example, you could set the field to **12.x** directly, but also **>=12.0.0** or **>=10.0.0**, because they satisfy the same contraints.

<Note type="warning">
  Our upstream providers unfortunately do not support passing a specific version
  like <InlineCode>12.14.0</InlineCode>. Only "more loose" values like{' '}
  <InlineCode>12.x</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>>=12.0.0</InlineCode> will work.
</Note>

### Node.js Dependencies

**For dependencies** listed in a `package.json` file at the root of a project, the following behavior is used:

- If a `package-lock.json` file is present in the project, `npm install` is used.
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used, by default.

### Using TypeScript with the Node.js Runtime

The Node.js Runtime supports files ending with `.ts` inside of the `/api` directory as TypeScript files to compile and serve when deploying.

An example TypeScript file that exports a default Node.js function and takes in [the standard Node.js Request and Response](#official-runtimes/node-js/node-js-request-and-response-objects) objects is as follows:

```js
import { NowRequest, NowResponse } from '@now/node'

export default function(req: NowRequest, res: NowResponse) {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

<Caption>
  An example serverless Node.js function written in TypeScript, using types from
  the <InlineCode>@now/node</InlineCode> module for the helper methods.
</Caption>

The `NowRequest` and `NowResponse` imports in the above example are types that we provide for [the Request and Response objects](#official-runtimes/node-js/node-js-request-and-response-objects), including the helper methods with ZEIT Now. These types can be installed from npm with the following command:

<Snippet dark text="npm install @now/node --save-dev" />
<Caption>Installing <InlineCode>@now/node</InlineCode> for types when using Node.js on ZEIT Now.</Caption>

You can also use a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of your project to configure the TypeScript compiler. Most options are supported aside from ["Path Mappings"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) and ["Project References"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html).

### Node.js Request and Response Objects

Each request to a Node.js Serverless Function gives access to Request and Response objects. These objects are the standard HTTP [Request](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request) and [Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) objects from Node.js.

#### Node.js Helpers

ZEIT Now additionally provides helper methods inside of the Request and Response objects passed to Node.js Serverless Functions. These methods are:

| method             | description                                                                                                                                                                                    | object   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `req.query`        | An object containing the request's [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string), or `{}` if the request does not have a query string.                                            | Request  |
| `req.cookies`      | An object containing the cookies sent by the request, or `{}` if the request contains no cookies.                                                                                              | Request  |
| `req.body`         | An object containing the body sent by the request, or `null` if no body is sent.                                                                                                               | Request  |
| `res.status(code)` | A function to set the status code sent with the response where `code` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). Returns `res` for chaining. | Response |
| `res.send(body)`   | A function to set the content of the response where `body` can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`.                                                                                       | Response |
| `res.json(obj)`    | A function to send a JSON response where `obj` is the JSON object to send.                                                                                                                     | Response |

The following Node.js Serverless Function example showcases the use of `req.query`, `req.cookies` and `req.body` helpers:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  let who = 'anonymous'

  if (req.body && req.body.who) {
    who = req.body.who
  } else if (req.query.who) {
    who = req.query.who
  } else if (req.cookies.who) {
    who = req.cookies.who
  }

  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${who}!`)
}
```

  <InlineCode>req.query</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>req.cookies</InlineCode>, and{' '}
  <InlineCode>req.body</InlineCode> helpers. It returns greetings for the user
  specified using <InlineCode>req.send()</InlineCode>.

  </Link>
  .
</Note>

#### `req.body`

We populate the `req.body` property with a parsed version of the content sent with the request when possible.

We follow a set of rules on the `Content-type` header sent by the request to do so:

| `Content-Type` header               | Value of `req.body`                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No header                           | `undefined`                                                                             |
| `application/json`                  | An object representing the parsed JSON sent by the request.                             |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | An object representing the parsed data sent by with the request.                        |
| `text/plain`                        | A string containing the text sent by the request.                                       |
| `application/octet-stream`          | A [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) containing the data sent by the request. |

With the `req.body` helper, you can build applications without extra dependencies or having to [parse the content of the request manually](https://nodejs.org/ja/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body).

## Go

<Tag>Status: Alpha</Tag>

The Go Runtime is used by Now to compile Go Serverless Functions that expose a single HTTP handler, from a `.go` file within an `/api` directory at your project's root.

For example, define an `index.go` file inside an `/api` directory as follows:

```go
package handler

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "<h1>Hello from Go on Now!</h1>")
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.go</InlineCode> file inside an{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

For advanced usage, such as using private packages with your Go projects, see the [Advanced Go Usage section](#advanced-usage/advanced-go-usage).

<Note>
  The exported function needs to include the{' '}
  <Link href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#HandlerFunc">
    <InlineCode>HandlerFunc</InlineCode>
  </Link>{' '}
  signature type, but can use any valid Go exported function declaration as the
  function name.
</Note>

### Go Version

Go version 1.x is used for Go projects deployed with ZEIT Now.

### Go Dependencies

The Go Runtime will automatically detect a `go.mod` file to install dependencies at the root of a project.

---

## Python

<Tag>Status: Beta</Tag>

The Python Runtime is used by Now to compile Python Serverless Functions, that defines a singlular HTTP `handler` variable, inheritting from the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class, from a `.py` file within an `/api` directory at your project's root.

For example, define an `index.py` file inside a `/api` directory as follows:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from cowpy import cow

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','text/plain')
        self.end_headers()
        message = cow.Cowacter().milk('Hello from Python from a ZEIT Now Serverless Function!')
        self.wfile.write(message.encode())
        return
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file inside an{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
cowpy==1.0.3
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file that defines{' '}
  <InlineCode>cowpy</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

For advanced usage, such as using WSGI or ASGI for your Python projects, see the [Advanced Python Usage section](#advanced-usage/advanced-python-usage).

### Python Version

Python projects deployed with ZEIT Now use Python version 3.6.

### Python Dependencies

You can install dependencies for your Python projects by defining them in a `requirements.txt` or a `Pipfile.lock` file.

---

## Ruby

<Tag>Status: Alpha</Tag>

The Ruby Runtime is used by Now to compile Ruby Serverless Functions that define a singlular HTTP handler from `.rb` files within an `/api` directory at your project's root.

Ruby files must have one of the following variables defined:

- `Handler` proc that matches the `do |req, res|` signature.
- `Handler` class that inherits from the `WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet` class.

For example, define a `index.rb` file inside a `/api` directory as follows:

```ruby
require 'cowsay'

Handler = Proc.new do |req, res|
    res.status = 200
    res['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
    res.body = Cowsay.say('hello world', 'cow')
end
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.rb</InlineCode> file inside an{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

Inside a `Gemfile` define:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "cowsay", "~> 0.3.0"
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>Gemfile</InlineCode> file that defines{' '}
  <InlineCode>cowpy</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

For advanced usage, such as using a Rack Interface for your Ruby projects, see the [Advanced Ruby Usage section](#advanced-usage/advanced-ruby-usage).

### Ruby Version

Ruby 2.5.5 is used.

### Ruby Dependencies

This Runtime supports installing dependencies defined in the `Gemfile`. Alternatively, dependencies can be vendored with the `bundler install --deployment` command (useful for gems that require native extensions). In this case, dependencies are not built on deployment.
