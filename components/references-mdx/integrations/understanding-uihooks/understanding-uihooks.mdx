# Understanding UIHooks

A UIHook is the main component of a <OrgName /> Integration. In [the Creating an Integration section](#creating-an-integration), we used a utility from the `@zeit/integration-utils` module to [create a UIHook](#creating-an-integration/step-2-creating-a-uihook).

The module we used is only available when using Node.js to build the UIHook, but a UIHook can be created using any programming language or framework.
