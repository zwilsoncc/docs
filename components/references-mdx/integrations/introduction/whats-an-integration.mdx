## What Makes an Integration?

Before your start building your first Integration, the following is an explanation of what an Integration is built of:

- A HTTP endpoint that receives a [<OrgName /> API](/docs/api) token, written in any language, called [a UIHook](/docs/integrations#understanding-uihooks).
- It can store data such as user configuration and tokens in the [Metadata Store](#using-the-metadata-store).
- It can return a string of HTML, using [ready-made components](#component-catalog), as the HTTP response to build UI elements.
- It can provide an [interactive UI](#creating-user-interfaces) right inside the <OrgName /> Dashboard.
- It supports OAuth 2.

With <OrgName /> Integrations you have opportunity to **dramatically simplify the process of using your product for your customers**.
