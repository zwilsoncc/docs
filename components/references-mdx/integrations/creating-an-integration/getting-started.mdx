# Creating An Integration

A <OrgName /> Integration is delivered to the user through a [UIHook](#understanding-uihooks).

A UIHook is an HTTP POST endpoint that returns a HTML string, composed of custom [ready-made](#component-catalog), or user-made, components, as the response.

The following is a walkthrough for how to make an Integration, comprising of a UIHook. This example uses the Node.js wrapper for the UIHook which is optimized for [<ProductName />](/docs/v2/platform/overview/#versioning) deployments.
