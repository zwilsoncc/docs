## Step 4: Add a Configuration

You can visit the [Marketplace URL](#creating-an-integration/step-3-creating-your-integration/marketplace-url) from the previous step and **click the "Add" button** to add a configuration to your installation.

Then, you can select a <OrgName /> account to add the configuration to:

  width={2434/2}
  height={1618/2}
/>

Once added, the user will be taken to the configuration page, it will look like this:

  width={2434/2}
  height={1618/2}
/>

### Finding Configurations

Once added, finding the configuration can be done by clicking the Integrations section through main navigation on the [<OrgName /> Dashboard](/dashboard).

If you are inside a project, there is a section called **Integrations** as well. It will show all the configurations affecting that particular project.

When the UIHook receives a request, it contains [information related](#understanding-uihooks/http-payload) to the project being viewed currently. Based on that, your UIHook can decide what HTMl components should be sent as the response.
