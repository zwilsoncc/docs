## Step 6: Publishing Your Integration

We recommend you create a separate Integration to deploy into production. That way you have two Integrations, one for development and one for production.

This allows you to maintain a stable version of your Integration whilst still being free to develop new features for it in a safe environment.

To deploy your UIHook into production, **all it takes is one command**:

<TerminalInput>now --target=production</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying a UIHook to <Link href="/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain">a production environment</Link>.</Caption>

The output from this command will contain the alias URL for your UIHook, you should add this to your Integration in the **UI Hook URL** field.

<Note>You can change the UIHook URL of your Integration anytime you wish.</Note>
