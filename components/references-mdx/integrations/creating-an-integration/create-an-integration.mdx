## Step 3: Creating Your Integration

With a UIHook created, you can now create the Integration on <OrgName />.

To do this, visit the [Integrations Developer Console](/dashboard/integrations/console) and **click the Create button**.

Complete the form and at the end you will find two fields named:

- **Redirect URL**
- **UI Hook URL**

For now, you can leave the Redirect URL empty and add <http://localhost:5005> to the **UI Hook URL** field.

<Note type="warning">
We recommend using <b>Google Chrome</b> for local UIHook development.

To work with UIHooks using either Safari or Firefox, you will require the use of a tunnelling service such as <Link href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</Link>.

When using <InlineCode>ngrok</InlineCode>, the command <InlineCode>ngrok http 5000</InlineCode> will provide you with an address that can be used in the <b>UI Hook URL</b> field.

</Note>

### Marketplace URL

Once you create your Integration, you can see it listed on the [Integrations Developer Console](/dashboard/integrations/console).

Inside your Integration, you can **click the View In Marketplace button** to see it in the marketplace.

Clicking this button will take you the **Public URL** for your Integration. This URL can be shared with anyone who wishes to install and use your Integration.

The Public URL has the following format:

<Code>https://vercel.com/integrations/:slug</Code>
<Caption>An example <b>Public URL</b> for an Integration.</Caption>
