## Components

Inside an UIHook you can use a set of whitelisted components. These components will be parsed and rendered in the <OrgName /> Dashboard.

For security reasons, these components have some minor limitations:

- No HTML elements are allowed
- Script and Style tags are not supported
- JavaScript support is disabled
- Only a set of whitelisted components are supported

These limitations may seem restrictive, but with very good reason.

These limitations allow us to expose a way for you to introduce UI elements into the <OrgName /> Dashboard without requiring manual verification.

We also provide a set of [rich components](/docs/integrations#component-catalog) that allow you to receive user inputs, implement styling and even poll for changes.
