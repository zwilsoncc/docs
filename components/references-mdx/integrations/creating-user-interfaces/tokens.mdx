## Tokens

Every request to a UIHook will receive a token which can be used to make requests to the <OrgName /> API for the related account.

This is a **short-lived token**. Therefore, you should only use it inside the UIHook. You **should not use it** inside asynchronous functions which are executed even after you return the UIHook response.

If you need a **long-lived token**, you can ask for a [OAuth2 token](/docs/integrations#building-oauth-integrations).

You can access this property inside `payload.token`.

When you use the `@zeit/integration-utils` utility, you **do not** need to extract this token manually. You will receive an instance called `zeitClient` which is initialized with the above token and account information. You can use that to consume the <OrgName /> token.

This is how you can get that instance:

```js
const { withUiHook } = require('@zeit/integration-utils')

module.exports = withUiHook(({ payload, zeitClient }) => {
  // Do something with the zeitClient and payload
  return `<Page>and return some JSX.</Page>`
})
```

You can inspect the [API and methods of `zeitClient`](https://github.com/zeit/integration-utils/blob/master/src/zeit-client.ts) to understand its capabilities.
