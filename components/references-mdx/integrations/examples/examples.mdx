# Examples

With the previous [Creating an Integration](#creating-an-integrations) section, you should now have a clearer idea of how to create an Integration. In this section, you will find a few more examples and see what more you can do with the <OrgName /> Integrations.

All of these examples contains a README file showing how to run them locally, however most of them uses the following process:

- Create an Integration using the <OrgName /> Dashboard
- Set the UIHook URL to <http://localhost:5005>
- Add a configuration for the Integration
- Install your project's dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the Integration's UIHook locally with `now dev --listen 5005`
- Access a configuration for the Integrations from the <OrgName /> Dashboard
- Then you see your UIHook in action.
