# Global

Using the following files and configuration options, you can configure [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download) under your system user.

There are two global configuration files; `config.json` and `auth.json`. By default, these files are held in a directory named `.now` within the user's home directory. For example on Unix based systems they will be found at `~/.now/*.json`.

## config.json

This file is used for global configuration of <ProductName /> deployments. <ProductShortName /> CLI uses this file as a way to co-ordinate how deployments should be treated, consistently.

The first option is a single `_` that gives a description to the file, if a user should find themselves looking through it without context.

The following options are all of the options that can be used by users to configure their <ProductName /> deployments globally on their system for that user profile:

### currentTeam

**Type**: `String`.

**Valid values**: A [team ID](/docs/api/#endpoints/teams/list-all-your-teams).

This option tells [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download) which context is currently active. If this property exists and contains a team ID, that team is used as the scope for deployments, otherwise if this property does not exist, the user's personal account is used.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "currentTeam": "team_ofwUZockJlL53hINUGCc1ONW"
}`}</Code>

### api

**Type**: `String`.

**Valid values**: [An API Origin URL](/docs/api/#api-basics/server-specs/origins).

This option selects which API Origin [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download) should use when performing an action requiring the API.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "api": "https://api-sfo1.zeit.co"
}`}</Code>

### collectMetrics

**Type**: `Boolean`.

**Valid values**: `true` (default), `false`.

This option defines whether [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download) should collect anonymous metrics about which commands are invoked the most, how long they take to run, and which errors customers are running into.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "collectMetrics": true
}`}</Code>

## auth.json

This file should not be edited manually. It exists to contain the authentication information for the <ProductName /> clients.

In the case that you are uploading your global configuration setup to a potentially insecure destination, we highly recommend ensuring that this file will not be uploaded, as it allows an attacker to gain access to your provider accounts.
