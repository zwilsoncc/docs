When you trigger a deploy, <ProductName /> **builds** your project. For many frontend frameworks, <ProductName /> automatically configures the build settings, but you can also [customize](#customizing-build-settings) them. You can also use [environment variables](#environment-variables) to avoid hardcoding values.

## Customizing Build Settings

To customize the build settings for your project, choose a project from the [dashboard](/dashboard):

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/common/select-project.png`}
  width={1102 / 2}
  height={410 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>Selecting the project from the <OrgName /> Dashboard.</Caption>

Then, select the **Settings** tab:

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/common/select-settings.png`}
  width={626 / 2}
  height={340 / 2}
  shadow
  borderRadius
/>
<Caption>Selecting the <b>Settings</b> tab from the Project Overview page.</Caption>

You can then edit the build settings from the **Build & Development Settings**, **Root Directory**, and **Environment Variables** sections.

### Build & Development Settings

&#8203;<ProductName /> tries to automatically detect the frontend framework you’re using for your project and configure the project settings for you. If you’d like to override the settings or specify a different framework, you can do so from the **Build & Development Settings** section.

#### Framework Preset

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/framework-preset.png`}
  width={1386 / 2}
  height={162 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>The Framework Preset setting.</Caption>

&#8203;<ProductName /> detects the following frontend frameworks automatically and chooses the best default settings for you.

<div>{props.frameworks}</div>

If no framework is detected, "Other" will be selected for you.

You can always choose a different framework preset or "Other" if you’d like.

#### Build Command

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/build-command.png`}
  width={1386 / 2}
  height={114 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>The Build Command setting.</Caption>

If <ProductName /> detects a framework, the Build Command will automatically be configured. Depending on a framework, the Build Command can refer to the project’s configuration file.

For example, if you choose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), here’s what happens by default:

- If `package.json` contains the `build` command in `scripts`, this command will be used to build the project.
- If not, `next build` will be the Build Command.

If you’d like to override the Build Command, you can turn on the **Override** toggle and specify the command.

<Note>
  If you update this setting, it will be applied starting with your next
  deployment.
</Note>

**If build is not required**: Some projects do not require building. An example of this would be a website with basic HTML/CSS/JS/assets that can be deployed directly without building (For example, you might just have a single `index.html` file).

In such cases, you should:

- Specify "Other" as the framework preset, and
- Override the Build Command and leave it empty. This will make <ProductName /> to skip the build step.

#### Output Directory

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/output-directory.png`}
  width={1386 / 2}
  height={114 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>The Output Directory setting.</Caption>

After building a project, most frameworks will output the result in a directory. Contents in this **output directory** will be the only things that will be statically served by <ProductName />.

If <ProductName /> detects a framework, the output directory will automatically be configured.

<Note>
  If you update this setting, it will be applied starting with your next
  deployment.
</Note>

In some cases, your project might not require building, and you might just want to serve the files in the root directory. If so, try the following:

- Choose "Other" as the framework preset. If you do so, by default, the output directory will be set as `public` if it exists, or `.` (current directory) otherwise.
- Therefore, as long as your project doesn’t have the `public` directory, it will serve the files in the root directory.
- Alternatively, you can turn on the **Override** toggle and leave the field empty (in which case, the build step will be skipped).

#### Development Command

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/development-command.png`}
  width={1386 / 2}
  height={114 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>The Development Command setting.</Caption>

<Note>
  This setting is relevant only if you’re using <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode>{' '}
  locally to develop your project. You should be using{' '}
  <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> only if you need to use a <ProductName />{' '}
  platform feature like{' '}
  <Link href="/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction">
    Serverless Functions
  </Link>
  . In other cases, you should use the development command your framework provides
  (such as <InlineCode>next dev</InlineCode> for Next.js).
</Note>

The Development Command setting allows you to customize the behavior of <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode>. If <ProductName /> detects a framework, the development command will automatically be configured.

If you’d like to use a custom command for <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode>, you can turn on the **Override** toggle. Please note the following:

- If you specify a custom command, your command must pass the `$PORT` variable (which contains the port number) to your framework. For example, for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), you should use: `next dev --port $PORT`.
- If the development command is not specified, `now dev` will fail. If you selected "Other" as the framework preset, the development command will be empty by default.
- You must create a deployment and have your local project be linked to the project on <ProductName /> (using `now`). Otherwise, `now dev` won’t work correctly.

### Root Directory

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/root-directory.png`}
  width={1242 / 2}
  height={242 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>The Root Directory setting.</Caption>

In some projects, the top-level directory of the repository may not be the root directory of the app you’d like to build. For example, your repository might have a `frontend` directory, which contains a stand-alone [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app.

In cases like this, you can specify the project root directory. If you do so, please note the following:

- If you specify a root directory, then your app won’t be able to access files outside of that directory. You also cannot use `..` to move up a level.
- This setting also applies to [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download). Instead of running `now <directory-name>` to deploy, specify `<directory-name>` here so you can just run `now`.

<Note>
  If you update this setting, it will be applied starting with your next
  deployment.
</Note>

## Environment Variables

Environment Variables are accessible during both **Build Step** and **Runtime**, and can be configured for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** Environments individually.

This allows you to include values that you don't want to share in your code or to change the behavior of your code depending on its Environment.

To declare an Environment Variable for your deployment, head to the **General** page of your **Project Settings** and locate the **Environment Variables** section.

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/env-vars-empty.png`}
  width={1488 / 2}
  height={824 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>The Environment Variables settings.</Caption>

First, choose between the following **Environments**:

| Environment     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Production**  | When selected, the Environment Variable will be applied to your next Production Deployment. To create a Production Deployment, push a commit to the default branch or run `now --prod`.         |
| **Preview**     | The Environment Variable is applied to your next Preview Deployment. Preview Deployments are created when you push to a branch (for example, `my-new-feature`) or run `now`.                    |
| **Development** | The Environment Variable is for use when running your project locally, with `now dev` or your preferred development command. To download Development Environment Variables, run `now env pull`. |

Enter the **Name** of the Environment Variable. For example, if you are using Node.js and you create an Environment Variable named `SENTRY_KEY`, it will be available under `process.env.SENTRY_KEY` in your code.

Then, enter the **Value** of the Environment Variable. The value is automatically encrypted and stored as a _Secret_ in our system when you click **Add**.

  width={1488 / 2}
  height={632 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>Adding an Environment Variable in the Project Settings.</Caption>

Once added, the Environment Variable is applied to your subsequent deployment.
It can then be consumed during **Build Step** by the framework of your choice, or by a Serverless Function at **Runtime**.

<Note>
  If any Environment Variables differ between Deployments,{' '}
  <Link href="/docs/v2/platform/deployments#deduplication">deduplication</Link>{' '}
  will always be bypassed. For example, this means that merging to the default
  branch will no longer result in an instant deployment.
</Note>

### Development Environment Variables

Environment Variables created for the Development Environment can be downloaded into a local development setup using the `now env pull` command provided by [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download):

<Snippet clipboard={false} dark text={`now env pull
Downloading Development Environment Variables for project my-lovely-project
✅ Created .env file [510ms]`} />
<Caption>Downloading Development Environment Variables with `now env pull`.</Caption>

Running the command will create a `.env` file in your project folder. The `.env` file can then be consumed by `now dev` or
your preferred development command.

Check out the [<ProductShortName /> CLI reference](/docs/now-cli#commands/env) to learn more about `now env` commands.

### Integration Environment Variables

[Integrations](/integrations) can automatically add Environment Variables to your Project Settings.
In that case, the Integration Configuration that added it will be displayed:

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/env-vars-integration.png`}
  width={1488 / 2}
  height={728 / 2}
  shadow

<Caption>Adding an Integration Environment Variable in the Project Settings.</Caption>

<Note>
  Support for Integration Environment Variables was added on April 10th, 2020.
  Variables added before that date do not have the <Strong>Integration</Strong>{' '}
  indication.
</Note>

### System Environment Variables

&#8203;<ProductName /> provides a set of Environment Variables that are optionally populated by the System, such as the URL of the Deployment or the name of the Git branch deployed.

To apply a System Environment Variable to your Deployment, enter its **Name**, leave the **Value** empty, and click **Add**.

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/build-step/env-vars-system.png`}
  width={1488 / 2}
  height={632 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>Adding a System Environment Variable in the Project Settings.</Caption>

The following System Environment Variables are available:

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHeadCell className="head-cell">Name</TableHeadCell>
      <TableHeadCell className="head-cell">Description</TableHeadCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHead>
  <TableBody>
    {SYSTEM_ENVS.map(systemEnv => (
      <TableRow key={systemEnv.name}>
        <TableRowCell>
          <InlineCode>{systemEnv.name}</InlineCode>
        </TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{systemEnv.description}</TableRowCell>
      </TableRow>
    ))}
  </TableBody>
</Table>

### Reserved Environment Variables

The <ProductName /> platform reserves the usage of some Environment Variable names by default. You can find a list of these names in the [limits documentation](/docs/v2/platform/limits/#reserved-variables).

## Ignored Files and Folders

By default, <ProductName /> ignores certain files and folders for security and performance reasons, preventing them from being uploaded during the deployment process.

```bash
.hg
.git
.gitmodules
.svn
.cache
.next
.now
.npmignore
.dockerignore
.gitignore
.*.swp
.DS_Store
.wafpicke-*
.lock-wscript
.env.local
.env.*.local
.venv
npm-debug.log
config.gypi
node_modules
__pycache__/
venv/
CVS
```

<Caption>

  deployment process.

<Note>
  You do not need to add any of the above files and folders to your{' '}
  <InlineCode>.nowignore</InlineCode> file.
</Note>

## Technical Details

### Maximum Build Duration

A build can last for a maximum of 30 minutes. If the build exceeds this time, the deployment will error.

### Caching

Each build step will cache files used to build the project, or files used in subsequent deployments, such as `node_modules`, `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, which are cached by default.

The caching mechanism for builds ensures that the next deployment will happen quicker by skipping downloading files that have already been used in a previous deployment.

The maximum stored cache for builds is 500MB.

If a deployment fails, a cache may still be established for successfully built files, but failed builds will not be cached.

### Private npm Modules for Static Builds

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in a `now.json` file.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

### Prevent Installing Development Dependencies

In some rare cases, you may wish to skip installing `devDependencies` defined in your `package.json` file and only install `dependencies`.

This can be achieved by assigning `NPM_ONLY_PRODUCTION=1` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env).

This is equivalent to `npm install --only=production` or `yarn install --production`.

### Prevent Cache Usage

If you need to ignore the cache for a deployment, you can do so by using the [`-f` flag for <ProductShortName /> CLI](/docs/now-cli/#commands/overview/global-options). This prevents the cache from being used in the deployment and ensures a fresh install for all dependencies.

### Framework Versioning

Some frameworks do not use `package.json` to select a specific version to install during build time.

By including [a `build.env` configuration property](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in [a `now.json` file](/docs/configuration) at your project's root, you can define your framework's version with one of the following keys:

| Framework | Build Env Key  |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Hugo      | `HUGO_VERSION` |
| Zola      | `ZOLA_VERSION` |

For example, defining the Hugo version in a `now.json` file would look like the following snippet:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "HUGO_VERSION": "0.61.0"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example of defining a version for Hugo with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> configuration.
</Caption>

<Note>
  The value must match an existing GitHub Release with an attached asset. For
  example, Hugo{' '}
  <InlineCode>
    <Link href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.42.0">
      0.42.0
    </Link>
  </InlineCode>{' '}
  does not exist but Hugo{' '}
  <InlineCode>
    <Link href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.42">0.42</Link>
  </InlineCode>{' '}
  does exist.
