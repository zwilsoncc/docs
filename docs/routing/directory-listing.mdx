## Directory Listing

The content of any path that does not contain an **Index File** (within a deployment) is rendered using our **Directory Listing**.

Here is an example of how this could look like:

<Image src={`https://assets.zeit.co/image/upload/v1541617859/front/docs/routing/directory-listing/preview.png`}
  width={1232/2}
  height={764/2}
/>

As you can see, the directory listing contains three items:

- `first.png` and `second.php` are **Lambdas**
- `third.png` is a **Static File**

However, no **Index File** is present. If one would be present, the path of the **Directory Listing** would render that file instead.

### Index Files

Files that match all of the following criteria are considered **Index Files** and rendered in place of the path of the directory that they are located in:

- The file name is either `index` or `index.<extension>` (where `<extension>` is any file extension of your choice).
- The file name **does not** end with a `.` or contain multiple `.` in a row.

### Types of List Items

There are two types of list items (which matches the **Output** of a **Build**):

- **Static Files** (indicated with a blank or picture icon)
- **Lambdas** (indicated with a λ icon)

### Disabling the Directory Listing

In the case that you would like to hide the **Directory Listing** for a certain path, you have the following two choices:

#### Include a Index File

As mentioned above, the **Directory Listing** will only occur if there is no **Index File** inside the path the client is trying to access.

That means placing a **Index File** that looks like a "Not Found" error page inside the path will make the visitor think the path does not exist.

#### Rewrite to a 404 page

The recommended way to hide **Directory Listings**, however, is to create a new rewrite using the `routes` property in `now.json` like this:

```
"routes": [
    {
        "src": "/example",
        "dest": "/404.html",
        "status": 404
    }
]
```

In the example above, the `/example` route (which is a directory without an **Index File**, thus would render a **Directory Listing**) is rewritten to render the `/404.html` file instead.

Furthermore, we are setting a status code of `404` to accompany the response.
